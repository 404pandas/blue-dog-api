Say g’day to all of Bluey’s friends

Bluey
Bluey
Bluey is a 6 year old Blue Heeler pup who loves to play. Her parents and teacher give her lots of time to practice, which means she’s become very good at inventing games, helping everyone choose their roles and deciding on the rules. Her favourite games are ones that involve lots of other kids and grown-ups (especially her dad) and she mainly likes to pretend she’s a grown up doing grownup things herself.

Bingo
Bingo
Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.

Bandit
Bandit
Dad is an archaeologist (he loves to dig up bones). As the devoted, yet tired father, he does his best to use whatever energy is left after interrupted sleep, work and household chores, to invent and play games with his two girls. He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!

Chilli
Chilli
After having the kids, Mum’s recently gone back to her job working at Airport Security and juggles this with raising her two little kids. Mum often has a wry comment about the kids' antics or a kind word for an overwrought child, but she’s equally at home throwing herself into a game and always able to see the funny side.
