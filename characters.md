Bluey
Bluey
Bluey is a 6 year old Blue Heeler pup who loves to play. Her parents and teacher give her lots of time to practice, which means she’s become very good at inventing games, helping everyone choose their roles and deciding on the rules. Her favourite games are ones that involve lots of other kids and grown-ups (especially her dad) and she mainly likes to pretend she’s a grown up doing grownup things herself.

Trivia
Being the main protagonist, Bluey has never made an absence on any episode, except Turtleboy
She has only been absent in four shorts, namely Pea Pod Sausages, Green Bottles, Mower and Honk.
Viewer gender confusion: Bluey has frequently been mistaken as a male by many viewers, mainly due to her looking like her father, having some traits of a young boy and her being blue, a stereotypical "boy color". In fact, when the show first aired, nearly all initial viewers assumed Bluey and Bingo were male, as their gender had not been said in the first few episodes, though a few episodes later, it was stated that Bluey and Bingo were female dogs. Even after this, many people who have only seen small things from the show tend to think Bluey is a boy, it has even got to the point where plush toys of Bluey nearly always get put in the "boys toys" aisle of stores, and in some cases, the plush is even straight up listed as a "boy dog plush" in online listings of it. The confusion was further fueled in Kids, when a cashier says to Bluey, "What a nice young boy you have there!" (refering to Bandit), as many people believed that the cashier was talking to Bandit.
Fandom nod: This is later referenced in a few episodes, in Double Babysitter when Uncle Rad said, "cause he's blue," after which Bluey corrects him, saying that she is a girl.
Bluey's favourite animal is fruit bat, as seen in Fruit Bat.
Bluey's favourite colour of capsicum (bell pepper) is yellow, as mentioned in the episode BBQ.
Bluey's favourite breakfast is fruit salad, as mentioned in the episode Fruit Bat.
Bluey's older version can be seen at the end of episode Camping.
Bluey's family is the first to have a known surname.
Bluey once played as a cameo, as seen on episode Army.
Bluey and Bingo have unlockable Emojis on the DisneyNOW app and website that can be used on the user's profile. These emojis use the art style of Disney Emoji Blitz, a match-3 puzzle game for mobile phones.
She may be unable to read as seen in Takeaway and Bus, although in some episodes as well as in the short Crazy Christmas Lights, she can be seen presumably reading a book. However, she might just be looking at pictures.
She is also intrigued by the fact that her buddy Mia can write, which could mean that she is unable to either.
In Library, she can be seen reading aloud, which could mean that Bluey is starting to be able to read. Though again, she could just be trying to retell the story through the pictures.
Throughout Bin Night, she is shown to have a white belt on an unspecified martial art.
Later in the episode, she can be seen advanced to the yellow belt.
Bluey plays the recorder, as shown in Queens and Bin Night.
Baby Race features Bluey when she was still a baby.
In Baby Race, Chilli confirms that Bluey is still two years older than Bingo, although she might just be approximating (either by default or excess).
It is possible while Bingo's fifth birthday happened in Handstand, Bluey’s seventh birthday is shown in Pass the Parcel
The long distance between her birthdays is somewhat noted by Bandit in Chest, being confused as to why Bluey is still six (she tells him she’s almost seven)
In Burger Shop, it is mentioned that she is in preschool, more specifically a preparatory school as stated in Calypso's bio.
In Jingle Bells short, this marks the first short where Bluey speaks.
Bluey is the first charcter to have their middle name revealed
In Family Meeting it is revealed her middle name is "Christine"
In the ABC Kids Listen app's Story Time promo, she briefly cameos as a drawing on a smartphone.
Even though she has the physical appearance of a Blue Heeler, she is technically a Red/Blue crossbreed.
It is likely that she is named after a real dog in Australia named Bluey, who lived to be nearly thirty years old and was the oldest dog to ever live. [1]
To protect their privacy and for "safety reasons", the identity of Bluey's voice actor is kept a secret from the public unlike many other children's TV shows which reveal actual names of children actors and actresses. And to this day, their identity is still a mystery. The same also goes for the other voice actors for many of the other children, including Bluey's sister, Bingo.
In Onesies, Bluey reveals that she does not like the fact that she looks similar to Bandit.
According to [Family Tree - Part 3)] by Aussie Girl Maggie, (which mentions Chili’s side of the Heeler family) apparently Bluey is stated to be nineteen before the end of Camping.

Bingo
Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.

Bingo and Socks, Bluey and Muffin's little sisters, have so far not had their middle names revealed.
Bingo has her own dedicated episode of the same name in season 2.
It is often shown that Lila is Bingo's best friend, which started through Lilas' first day at Kindergarten in Daddy Dropoff.
An older Bingo and Lila can also be seen at the end of the episode.
Bingo speaks with a faint, but noticeable nasally voice.
In some episodes, whenever she interacts with an insect, her close-ups are in 3D animation instead of 2D.
She is the second character (after Chloe) who had their birthday and aged up in the series.
In Sleepytime, Bingo was the second Bluey character that was pictured crying, instead of just tearing up.
She is also pictured crying when she first loss in Pass the Parcel.
Her favourite colour is blue as mentioned in Easter.
In The Pool, Helicopter and Duck Cake, it has been mentioned that Bingo is taking ballet, gymnastics and mini-hockey respectively.
While not as bad as her sister, Bingo often gets confused for a boy, since Bingo is usually a name for a male dog, and her voice can sometimes sound like a young boy. It helps, however, that Bingo looks a lot like her mother.
In addition, there is a popular children's rhyme about another dog named Bingo, who is said to be male. In fact, nearly every other dog named Bingo, real or fictional is male.

However, this seems to have improved through later episodes in the show, such as Pirates.

Bingo is very similiar in appearance to her aunt Brandy, as mentioned in Onesies.

Bluey.tv Description
"Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world."[1]

He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!"

Appearance
Bandit is a Blue Heeler with blue, light blue, tan and black fur. He has light blue feet, hands, outer belly, outer muzzle and eyebrows, blue legs, arms, tail tip and torso, tan belly, muzzle and inner ears, and black tail stem, head and outer ears. He also has a black nose and beard whiskers on his muzzle.

Personality
Bandit is a character that loves to play with his daughters. He will take his role in a game seriously even though he's often seen unwilling and reluctant whenever his daughters mention a game to play. While playing with his daughters, he often teaches them life lessons along the way.

Biography
Bandit is one of the members of the Heeler family. He's the husband of Chilli, the father of Bluey and Bingo, younger brother of Rad, older brother of Stripe, brother-in-law of Trixie, son of Bob and Nana, the uncle of Muffin and Socks and the son-in-law of Mort. He works as an archaeologist.

When he was younger, Bandit was a bully to his younger brother Stripe as a child. One day, Bandit was jinxed by Rad, so he was not allowed to speak until someone said his name.

At the time he was at England, he met Chilli or possibly someone who looked similar to her, she now has no memory of this occurring though she and her family has spent vacations there. There is “some dispute” as to the exact circumstances, but it apparently took place “at a party in London.”[1] Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met,[2] though Bandit argues later on that they had met in a holiday park when he was 10.[3] Eventually, the two began dating, and later on went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted; the pair were later married.[4] Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey.[5] Bandit would later claim to have “wrecked [his] back changing [Bluey’s] nappies,” though he probably only said this in jest. Bingo, their younger daughter, was born a couple of years later.[6]

Trivia
He is voiced by Dave McCormack, the frontman of Australian '90s Indie rock band Custard.
This is also the debut of McCormack in animated television, The next character to be voiced by a member of a band is Postie.
He used to play touch football, as mentioned in Fruitbat. He wants to do it again, but has been too busy with parenting and his job.
He likes to watch cricket, as seen in Horsey Ride & The Weekend.
He likes to play squash, as seen in Squash.
He burps after eating sauerkraut in the original dub of Chickenrat.
However, in the Disney dub, he sneezes after eating sauerkraut.
This could possibly mean he is allergic to sauerkraut.
Another possibility is they simply changed it to be more "family friendly" for America.
He loves bananas, but hates rockmelon (cantaloupe), as mentioned in Trampoline.
He makes several “dad-jokes” to Bluey and Bingo as shown in a couple of episodes of Season 1, most notably in The Creek and The Pool.
As of Season 2, he doesn’t do “dad-jokes” as much, but he still has his cheekiness in some episodes in Season 2.
He is the only male member of the main cast.
It is yet to be shown of where Bandit works.
A younger version of him can be seen in the flashback of the episode Baby Race, wherein he lacks the hairs.
Bandit farted at least in five episodes (as humour) in Daddy Robot, Fairies, Teasing,Family Meeting, and Smoochy Kiss, though this gag has decreased as of Season 2.
"Family Meeting" reveals that baked beans, nut roast, and pie can all give him gas.
Bandit can ride a skateboard as seen in Bob Bilby
Bandit once peed in a pool as seen and said by Chilli in Swim School.
He was claimed Dad of the Year in 2019.
Bandit is often seen reading the newspaper in most episodes.
Bandit’s child-friendly expletives are mostly food related phrases;
Bandit says, “Oh, Biscuits!” in several episodes.
He says, “Cheese and Crackers!” in Daddy Robot and Taxi.
He also says, “Beans on Toast!” and “Goodness Gravy!” in Taxi.
He says, “Bread and Jam!” in Tickle Crabs.
He exclaims, “Oh, Duck Cake!” in Duck Cake.
He says, “Crumbed Steak” in Road Trip.
Before the title cards when Bluey and Bingo decide what game to play, Bandit says “Oh no, not [NAME OF GAME]” after Bluey and/or Bingo says the name of the game.
He is left-handed, as revealed in The Claw.
He will get cranky when he is hungry, as revealed in Omelette.
A ten-year-old version of Bandit can be seen in Fairytale.
Bandit is revealed to be the middle child in the same episode.
In Fairytale, a cassette for the song "Bad Medicine" by Bon Jovi can be seen. This song was released in 1988, meaning that the events of Fairytale would have taken place during 1988 or 1989. Because Bandit was 10 years old in Fairytale, he would have been born some time between 1977 and 1979.
Assuming Season 3 takes place in 2022, this would place him somewhere between 43 and 45 years old in Season 3.
Bandit is revealed to have a doctorate in archaeology in Archaeology.
In Polish dub, his name is "Bandżi" (pronounced "bungee").
"Seesaw" reveals that he weighs about as much as Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, and Coco put together.
In "Movies", he's revealed to dislike musical movies, as when the character in the movie he and his daughters were watching started singing, he exclaimed, "Ugh! Songs!".
"Family Meeting" reveals that he charges his tablet on the bedside table and sometimes drops it.
It’s revealed in "Pavlova (Episode)" that Bandit, and possibly Chilli, in the English Dub, can both speak French. Because Bluey and Bingo don't speak French, Bandit takes advantage of that to speak nonsense French to them, as if teasing them.

Bluey.tv Description
"Dad is an archaeologist (he loves to dig up bones). As the devoted, yet tired father, he does his best to use whatever energy is left after interrupted sleep, work and household chores, to invent and play games with his two girls. He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!"

Appearance
Bandit is a Blue Heeler with blue, light blue, tan and black fur. He has light blue feet, hands, outer belly, outer muzzle and eyebrows, blue legs, arms, tail tip and torso, tan belly, muzzle and inner ears, and black tail stem, head and outer ears. He also has a black nose and beard whiskers on his muzzle.

Personality
Bandit is a character that loves to play with his daughters. He will take his role in a game seriously even though he's often seen unwilling and reluctant whenever his daughters mention a game to play. While playing with his daughters, he often teaches them life lessons along the way.

Biography
Bandit is one of the members of the Heeler family. He's the husband of Chilli, the father of Bluey and Bingo, younger brother of Rad, older brother of Stripe, brother-in-law of Trixie, son of Bob and Nana, the uncle of Muffin and Socks and the son-in-law of Mort. He works as an archaeologist.

When he was younger, Bandit was a bully to his younger brother Stripe as a child. One day, Bandit was jinxed by Rad, so he was not allowed to speak until someone said his name.

At the time he was at England, he met Chilli or possibly someone who looked similar to her, she now has no memory of this occurring though she and her family has spent vacations there. There is “some dispute” as to the exact circumstances, but it apparently took place “at a party in London.”[1] Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met,[2] though Bandit argues later on that they had met in a holiday park when he was 10.[3] Eventually, the two began dating, and later on went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted; the pair were later married.[4] Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey.[5] Bandit would later claim to have “wrecked [his] back changing [Bluey’s] nappies,” though he probably only said this in jest. Bingo, their younger daughter, was born a couple of years later.[6]

Trivia
He is voiced by Dave McCormack, the frontman of Australian '90s Indie rock band Custard.
This is also the debut of McCormack in animated television, The next character to be voiced by a member of a band is Postie.
He used to play touch football, as mentioned in Fruitbat. He wants to do it again, but has been too busy with parenting and his job.
He likes to watch cricket, as seen in Horsey Ride & The Weekend.
He likes to play squash, as seen in Squash.
He burps after eating sauerkraut in the original dub of Chickenrat.
However, in the Disney dub, he sneezes after eating sauerkraut.
This could possibly mean he is allergic to sauerkraut.
Another possibility is they simply changed it to be more "family friendly" for America.
He loves bananas, but hates rockmelon (cantaloupe), as mentioned in Trampoline.
He makes several “dad-jokes” to Bluey and Bingo as shown in a couple of episodes of Season 1, most notably in The Creek and The Pool.
As of Season 2, he doesn’t do “dad-jokes” as much, but he still has his cheekiness in some episodes in Season 2.
He is the only male member of the main cast.
It is yet to be shown of where Bandit works.
A younger version of him can be seen in the flashback of the episode Baby Race, wherein he lacks the hairs.
Bandit farted at least in five episodes (as humour) in Daddy Robot, Fairies, Teasing,Family Meeting, and Smoochy Kiss, though this gag has decreased as of Season 2.
"Family Meeting" reveals that baked beans, nut roast, and pie can all give him gas.
Bandit can ride a skateboard as seen in Bob Bilby
Bandit once peed in a pool as seen and said by Chilli in Swim School.
He was claimed Dad of the Year in 2019.
Bandit is often seen reading the newspaper in most episodes.
Bandit’s child-friendly expletives are mostly food related phrases;
Bandit says, “Oh, Biscuits!” in several episodes.
He says, “Cheese and Crackers!” in Daddy Robot and Taxi.
He also says, “Beans on Toast!” and “Goodness Gravy!” in Taxi.
He says, “Bread and Jam!” in Tickle Crabs.
He exclaims, “Oh, Duck Cake!” in Duck Cake.

He is left-handed, as revealed in The Claw.
He will get cranky when he is hungry, as revealed in Omelette.
A ten-year-old version of Bandit can be seen in Fairytale.
Bandit is revealed to be the middle child in the same episode.
In Fairytale, a cassette for the song "Bad Medicine" by Bon Jovi can be seen. This song was released in 1988, meaning that the events of Fairytale would have taken place during 1988 or 1989. Because Bandit was 10 years old in Fairytale, he would have been born some time between 1977 and 1979.
Assuming Season 3 takes place in 2022, this would place him somewhere between 43 and 45 years old in Season 3.
Bandit is revealed to have a doctorate in archaeology in Archaeology.
In Polish dub, his name is "Bandżi" (pronounced "bungee").
"Seesaw" reveals that he weighs about as much as Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, and Coco put together.
In "Movies", he's revealed to dislike musical movies, as when the character in the movie he and his daughters were watching started singing, he exclaimed, "Ugh! Songs!".
"Family Meeting" reveals that he charges his tablet on the bedside table and sometimes drops it.
It’s revealed in "Pavlova (Episode)" that Bandit, and possibly Chilli, in the English Dub, can both speak French. Because Bluey and Bingo don't speak French, Bandit takes advantage of that to speak nonsense French to them, as if teasing them.

Script.jpg
The classic distant view of the Heeler home is displayed, then cuts to the kitchen, where Chilli is cooking, Bluey is sitting and Bandit walking with a chess board.

Bandit: "Alright, here we go, Bluey." He puts down and opens the chess board on the kitchen countertop. "I'm gonna teach you how to play Chess."

Bluey: "What's Chest?"

Bandit: "No, not Chest, Chess." Putting out the chess pieces

Bluey: "Yeah, Chest."

Bandit: "Ok, fine." Flips over the chess board "I'm gonna teach ya how to play Chess."

Bluey: "Oh! It's like Checkers!"

Bandit: "Yeah, but a lot harder than Checkers."

Chilli: "And so probably a bit old for Bluey, right?"

Bandit: "Oh, how old are you?"

Bluey: "Don't you know how old is your own child is?"

Bandit: "I think I do, but just tell me."

Bluey: "I'm six!"

Bandit: "Are you still six? Wow."

Bluey: "I'm almost seven."

Bandit: "Well, I reckon that's old enough."

Chilli: Chopping carrots "Can I ask why you want to teach Bluey chess?"

Bandit: "To start people playing Chess."

Bingo comes in onto the wooden stepping stair stool prototype

Bingo: "Can I play?"

Bluey: "She's five."

Bandit: "Well, you might not be old enough for Chess, Bingo. But you can watch us play."

Bingo, sad: "Aww."

Bluey: "It's ok, Bingo. You can help me!"

Chilli: "Aw, Bluey."

Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey! Where's the dice?"

Bandit's facial expression turns into a "bruh"

TITLE CARD: Chest

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called, Chest."

TITLE CARD END

Bandit: "Ook, I'll show you the pieces."

Bingo: "Who are the little ball guys?" Holding up one of the white pawns on her and Bluey's side

Bandit: "They’re called "pawns"."

Bingo: "Prawns?"

Bandit: "No, not “prawns”." He puts the pawn down to it's spot from Bingo "Pawns!"

Bluey: "Hello, little prawn!"

Bandit: "Ok, so the pawns can move one square forward. Well, sometimes two squares, but only on the first turn, and can take diagonally, see?"

Bluey and Bingo just blankly stare into Bandit.

Bandit: "Eh, don't worry about that. Now, this goes-"

'Bluey places down a Charlevol figurine

Bandit: "Hang on, who's this?" Points to the figurine

Bingo: "This is Charevol."

Bluey: Places down a Bonny Bom Bom figurine "And this is Bonny Bom Bom!"

Bandit: "Ok, Charlevol and Bonny Bom Bom aren't invited." Putting both of the figurines at the side of the board

Bluey and Bingo: "Aww.."

Bluey: Gasping "A horsey!" Grabs the Knight piece

Bingo: "I've got one too!" Grabs the other Knight piece

Both of them squeal

Bandit: "Ok, he's the Knight."

Bingo: "No, he's a horsey!"

Bandit: "Yeah, he's called the Knight."

Bluey: "No, the Knight sits on the horsey!"

Bandit: "Well, yeah, that's true.”

Bingo: "Everyone knows that."

Chilli: "I thought you said smart people played Chess." Mixing something

Bandit: "Well, whatever you call him-"

Bingo: "Mine's called Gallahop!"

Bluey: "Mine's called... Daughter of Gallahop!"

Bandit: "He moves by jumping!"

Bluey: "Oh yes, horseys love jumping."

Bingo: "Oooh." Grabs the Rook piece "Who is Castlehead?"

Bandit: "That's the Rook."

Bingo: "I'm gonna call him Castlehead."

Bandit: "Fine, Castlehead moves straight like this." Demonstrating to the girls

Bingo: "Castles can't move! This game is confusing."

Bandit: "Yeah, it is Bingo. Maybe you want to do some colouring."

Bluey: "No, she's on my team!" Proceeding to hug Bingo to show that Bingo's on her team.

Bandit: "Agh, right, let's just start." Moves the pawn piece from A7 to A6 "You go, Bluey."

Bingo: "Aww, I want my own Chest team!"

Bandit: "But there is only two teams, Bingo, so maybe you just watch."

Bingo: "Aw."

Bluey: "Dont worry, Bingo." Proceeding to separate the white team in half "There's two horseys, see, two Castleheads, and two.. Pom Pom Elves?"

Bandit: "Bishops."

Bluey: "And the prawns."

Bandit, in an annoyed tone: "Pawnnnss."

Bluey: "So this can be your team, and this one's mine!"

Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey."

Chilli: "Nice one, Bluey." Putting something together which looks like something red

Bandit: "Uh, look, that’s not a-"

Chilli: "Let it go, Deep Blue."

Bluey: "Hang on." Grabs the Queen piece "There is only one crown lady."

Bingo: "And one Wedding Cake head!"

Bandit: "Ah, now that's the King, and that's the Queen."

Bingo and Bluey: Squeals "King and Queen!"

Bingo: "Can I have the Queen, Bluey?"

Bluey: "Uh.. sure!" Hands over the Queen piece for the King piece

Bingo: "THAANNNKS!"

Bandit: "Agh, you can't- eh, that's just fine." Swaps the King and Queen pieces on his side.

Bingo: "Are you sure you’re happy with the King?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I'm ok."

Bandit: "Don't worry, Bluey, the king is the most important piece on the board.

Chilli: unknown sound "Is that right?"

Bandit: "Yes."

Chilli: "And how many squares can he move?" Approaching to Bandit's side.

Bandit: "Well, just one."

Chilli: "Just one square? That was a big square, wasn't it?"

Bandit's face is completely just turns into a "bruh" again.

Chilli: "Oh, I rest my royal feeties. They’re a little tired!"

Bluey and Bingo laugh

Chilli: "Meanwhile," Bumping Bandit out of the way "The queen moves as far as she wants! In any direction. Which is handy, because she has to do all the work!" Moving the Queen piece that looks diagonally, horizontally and vertically

Bandit: "Are you finished?"

Chilli: "Yes."

Bandit: "Anyway, hey, where's Bingo?"

Bingo, having placed the queen on Bandit's bottom, moving to what it's on it's way to a nice lil' picnic

'Bingo: "Ooh, it's a lovely day for a picnic!"

Bandit: "Hey!" Grabbing the Queen piece onto their side while Bingo runs back to her side. Then having to clear up the chess board to it's original state before shenanigans happened.

Bluey: "I thought the queen could go anywhere!"

Bandit: "Bluey, have your turn!"

Bluey: "What do I do?"

Bandit: "Just move a prawn. Pawn!"

Bluey, moving a pawn on C2 to D3”

Bandit: "No, no. Forward only."

Bluey, then moving the pawn on D3 to C4

Bandit: "My turn."

Bingo: "Hey!"

Bandit: "Oh, yeup. Your turn."

Bingo gets on the kitchen countertop

Bingo: "I'm moving Gallahop!" Grabbing a Knight piece and a pawn piece, and moving the Knight from G1 to F6 and the pawn to G2 to F7, already occupying the pawn already from F7.

Bandit: "Ah, no, you can't go that far,mate, and you can't move 2 pieces at once."

Bingo: "But Boulderkiss wants to visit Ms. Shinyhead. They’re friends!"

Bandit: "Well, no, they’re actually enemies."

Bluey: "No, they’re friends!"

Bingo: "They’re little prawns so they can go to kindy together!"

Bandit: "Ok, they’re friends. Ok, watch, this is how you take a piece." He moves the pawn that's on E7 to F6, removing the Knight on F6.. "See?"

Bingo: Gasps "Gallahop!"

Bluey: "It's ok, he just starts back from here."

Bingo: "Oh, phew."

Bandit: "Nah, he's dead."

Bingo: "Gallahop is dead?!"

Chilli: "Of course he's not dead."

Bandit: "Oh,uh, yeah, he's not dead, he's just out of the game."

Bingo: "Awww."

Bandit: "I did say Chess might be a bit older for you."

Bluey: "You’re going to pay, young man. My turn. Right. Where can I move?"

Bandit: "Here or here."

Bluey: "Bang there." Moving the horse from B1 to A3

Bandit: "Ok, now, you see, it's important to keep your pieces protected. I can just take him, like this." Moving the bishop on F8 to A3, and removing the second Knight on the chess board

Bingo: Gasp "Daughter of Gallahop!"

Bluey: "Errgh!" Moving the pawn on C4 to C5

Bandit: "Yeah, I can just take him." Moving the Bishop from A3 to B2

Bluey: "What about here?" Moving the pawn from A2 to A3

Bandit: "Yeah, I'll take him again." Moving the Bishop on B2 to C1

Bluey: "Aah!"

Bingo: "Stop it!"

Bandit: "I'm just showing you the rules!"

Chilli: "Get the queen out, Bluey!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, time for another picnic!" Moving the Queen from E1 to E7, eliminating the pawn.

Bandit: "But... I have him protected." Moves the King from D8 to E7, eliminating the queen.

Bingo: Gasp "My queen!"

Bluey: "Oh, no!"

Chilli: "Really, Bandit!"

Bandit: "Ooh, it was the King who did the honours."

Bluey: "Mum! How do you beat Dad?"

Chilli: Taking off the apron and walking to Bandits side on the chess board. "It's easy."

Bandit: "Here we go."

Chilli: "I can beat him in 4 moves." Giving a bowl to Bingo, and taking the queen piece

Bingo: "Ooh."

Chilli: "I move this guy here." Moving the bishop on F1 to A6, eliminating a pawn.

Bandit: "Heh, great start." Moving the pawn on B7 to A6, removing the bishop. "Doink."

Chilli: "Then, I move him, and ask, “Why do you want to teach the kids this game?”" Moving the Rook from A1 to C1, eliminating the Bishop.

Bandit: Moves the pawn on D7 to D5.

Chilli: "And he answers, “Because smart people play chess.”"

Bingo takes all the chess pieces that were removed from the game

Chilli: "“And I want my kids to be smart.” Next move, I ask: “Why do you want the kids to be smart?”"

Bandit: "Heh, that's a bad move."

Chilli: "This is what I'll say. “Right now, you kids are little prawns."” Moving the pawn piece on F7 to F8, and then replacing the pawn with the Queen piece "“ But one day you'll be queens”."

Bandit removes the queen piece by moving the king piece from E7 to F8.

Chilli: "“And I won't always be there to protect you, so you have to look after yourselves.”"

Bluey jumps down the stepping stair thing to go play with Bingo, playing with the chess pieces.

Chilli: "Moving the piece from F2 to F4 "“But I'm going to do whatever I can now to help you.”"

Bandit: "Checkmate."

Chilli: "”Cause he's a good king.”"

Bandit: "And you’re a good queen."

Chilli: "But a lousy chess player."

Bandit: "And you turned out fine."

Chilli: "Work on the heads later, for now, just hearts." Putting her arm around Bandit

Bluey: Grabs the rook piece to the bowl thing "Here, Bingo!"

Bingo: "Ooh, welcome! First things first, you’re not dead, ok? You’re at a pool party! Yay!" Putting the Rook down into the bowl

It shows the end credits, with the King and Queen piece fading on the credits

Bluey.tv Description
"Bluey & Bingo’s Grandad."

Appearance
Bob is a Blue Heeler with white, grey, black, dark grey and brown fur. He has white feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, grey legs, leg spots, arms, torso, tail tip and head spots, dark grey leg splotches, leg spots, tail stem and right head, black outer ears, and brown leg spots, head spots, left head and inner ears. He also has a black nose, beard whiskers on his muzzle and part of his left ear missing.

In his younger years (during the 80s), his grey fur used to be blue and his dark grey and brown (on his head) fur used be black, similar to his son Bandit. His left ear also used to be whole as well.

Biography
Bob has no known real friends yet, but he is the husband of Chris (Nana), the dad of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the father-in-law of Chilli and Trixie, and the grandpa of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks.

S3E2 - Bedroom (mentioned)
S3E26 - Fairytale (flashback)
Trivia
He has a piece of his left ear missing.
Bob is voiced (as a retiree) by writer, actor, director, producer, teacher, essayist and painter Ian McFadyen.
Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback.
Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet.
In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering "proof of life" - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the "Grandad" stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family.
Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it.
This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence.
In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as "grandad" when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob.
His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode "Grannies", and in the Grannies book.
A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale
Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name.
He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit.
Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.

"After having the kids, Chilli’s recently gone back to her job working at Airport Security and juggles this with raising her two little pups. Mum often has a wry comment about the kids' antics or a kind word for an overwrought child, but she’s equally at home throwing herself into a game and always able to see the funny side."

Original
"After having the kids, Chilli’s recently gone back to her job working at Airport Security and juggles this with raising her two little pups, which means sometimes she falls a bit short of what her other mother friends are able to pull off."

Appearance
Chilli is a Red Heeler with cream, light orange and brown fur. She has cream feet, hands, tail spots, back spots, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, light orange legs, arms, tail, torso and head, brown outer ears and right head and light brown inner ears. She also has a dark brown nose.

Personality
Chilli is a character that cares about her family. She's a comforting character as seen on Yoga Ball and Sleepytime. She likes to play along with her daughter and husband whenever they're setting up games.

Biography
Chilli is a member of the Heeler family. She's the wife of Bandit, the mother of Bluey and Bingo, the aunt of Muffin and Socks, the daughter-in-law of Bob and Nana, and the sister-in-law of Trixie, Rad, and Stripe. Her father is Mort, and her older sister is Brandy.

Chilli works part-time in airport security.

As a child, Chilli spent a lot of time playing in "the scrub" near her father’s home[1]. Her family would vacation at a caravan park where Bandit would recall meeting as children; Chilli does not remember this, but admits it could be the case[2]. She recalls their first meeting being a party in London[3]. Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met[4].

The two began dating, and eventually went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted. The pair were later married[5]. Among the guests at the wedding were Frisky, who would later become Bluey’s godmother, and Bandit's brother Rad. The venue included a pool, which Rad "probably" fell into[6]. Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey[7]. Bingo, their youngest daughter, would be born a couple of years later[8].

Chilli currently lives with Bandit and her daughters in the suburbs.

She is the only member of the show's main family whose first name does not start with a B.
She is named after food, just like with Coco, Honey and Snickers.
In Sticky Gecko, Queens, Grandad and Perfect; Chilli displays a “very angry face”.
This indicates that Chilli is especially annoyed or irritated.
In Sticky Gecko, Chilli says, "Damn it. Really stuck!" This was cut from US releases because it is a swear in the US.
In Bin Night, she reveals that when they are little, heelers are a bit stubby, but tough.

Chilli is voiced by Australian actress, model, artist, journalist, and performer Melanie Zanetti.
She is named after the hot-tasting spicy vegetable of the same name; the Chilli Pepper.
Her maiden name may be Cattle, although this depends on whether or not Brandy is married. Brandy's last name was confirmed by Nick Rees on Twitter (@N1ckBee5) who made a poster for the Onesies episode and credited her last name as "Cattle”.[9]
She seems to enjoy eating sardines, as revealed in Smoochy Kiss.
Her job as airport security might be a reference to sniffer dogs, and she might even be one.
Chilli is known to frequently hum the show's theme song. Doing so across multiple episodes.

Trivia
She is not allowed to eat wheat/gluten, sugar, salt, dairy, or food with added ingredients (like prepackaged tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and mustard), whether it be due to her allergies, her religion, her tradition or her family's basic diet.
She is seen with longer hair in some episodes, but the studio shortened her hair to make it easier to animate.
When she had longer hair, she could be seen with green, blue, yellow, and pink hair rings.
The Early Baby episode reveals that Indy has a sister that either had a premature baby or was a preemie baby herself. (At the moment, this hasn't been elaborated on.) it can be assumed, though based on what Bluey says that it was her sister that had the premature or "early" baby since she says, "Indy wanted to play "Early Baby" like her sister in real life."
Another character that mentioned her sibling and still didn't appear in the series, is Winnie.
Her name is a diminutive of Indianapolis.

Her age was revealed to be 7 at the start of "Featherwand" .
In the episode "Featherwand" an invitation to her birthday party read by Chilli has an address of 26 Nudgee Road. In the episode "Octopus" her house has a number 101 on it; this may indicate that the party was held somewhere other than her house
Chloe’s house, as shown in episode "Octopus", have a number 101 which is a reference to a 1956 book The Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith and its 1961 animated film adaptation One Hundred and One Dalmatians, both focusing on family of 101 Dalmatian dogs. It might also refer to 2019 animated TV show 101 Dalmatian Street which aired on Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney+ same as Bluey.
She is the first character who had a birthday and aged up in the series.
Her favourite TV show is the same as Bluey's, Chunky Chimp.
In Polish version, her name is "Łatka" which means "Spot".
It's revealed in "Dunny" that her family bans her from using the word "naughty."

Jean-Luc is friends with Bluey and is the son of Jean-Luc's Dad and Jean-Luc's Mum.

Appearances

The Show (drawing cameo)
Trivia
Jean-Luc and his parents speak French.
He is French-Canadian in reference to how his breed – the Labrador Retriever – is named after the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. As the name suggests, the province is comprised of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland region of Labrador, which is located in the northeast of Canada and borders the predominantly French-speaking province of Québec. The province also lends its name to another breed of dog: the Newfoundland or "Newfie."
Jean-Luc is similar in appearance to Lucky, but isn’t slimmer towards his waist like Lucky and has different coloured fur.
His future self speaks English as seen at the end of Camping.
A drawing of him and Bluey can be seen in Bingo and The Show.
In the French dub, Jean Luc is renamed Johnny, and he speaks English.
This is the reverse of how it is in the original English version.
He only appears in one episode.
His name is pronounced "John-Luke."

"Bluey & Bingo’s Grandad."

Appearance
Bob is a Blue Heeler with white, grey, black, dark grey and brown fur. He has white feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, grey legs, leg spots, arms, torso, tail tip and head spots, dark grey leg splotches, leg spots, tail stem and right head, black outer ears, and brown leg spots, head spots, left head and inner ears. He also has a black nose, beard whiskers on his muzzle and part of his left ear missing.

In his younger years (during the 80s), his grey fur used to be blue and his dark grey and brown (on his head) fur used be black, similar to his son Bandit. His left ear also used to be whole as well.

Biography
Bob has no known real friends yet, but he is the husband of Chris (Nana), the dad of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the father-in-law of Chilli and Trixie, and the grandpa of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks.

SN/AEN/A - Humpty Dumpty (mentioned)

S3E26 - Fairytale (flashback)
Trivia
He has a piece of his left ear missing.
Bob is voiced (as a retiree) by writer, actor, director, producer, teacher, essayist and painter Ian McFadyen.
Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback.
Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet.
In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering "proof of life" - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the "Grandad" stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family.
Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it.
This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence.
In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as "grandad" when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob.
His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode "Grannies", and in the Grannies book.
A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale
Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name.
He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit.
Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.

Bosco
VIEW SOURCE
Bosco is a character mentioned in Bluey. So far, he has never made an appearance; only mentioned.

Frisky was his wife or girlfriend, later he broke up with her before the events of "Double Babysitter". It's never explained why they broke up, though given that Frisky, when acting as a princess for the Heeler sisters, said that Rad (who was playing the prince) would probably go looking for other princesses, this could imply that either Bosco cheated on Frisky, or Bosco dumped Frisky so that he could date another dog.

Appearance
Brandy is a Red Heeler with light orange, dark orange, light cream fur, and a brown nose. She has light cream hands, right foot, left outer ear, left leg, eyebrows, muzzle, forehead, tail spots, belly, a strip in her shoulders and tail end, light orange body, right leg, left foot, start of the tail and inner ears, and dark orange right outer ear, both sides of the head, back spot and tail spot.

Biography
Brandy is Chilli's older sister. She distanced herself due to the grief of her sister being able to grow a family while she herself had fertility issues. They hadn't spoken for years, but Chilli eventually found the courage to call her, which lead to them reuniting in Onesies.

S03E31 - Onesies (Debut)
Trivia
It is revealed Bluey didn't even know she had an aunt on her mum's side of the family.[citation needed]
A younger version of Brandy can be seen pictured in Obstacle Course and Promises.
The younger version of Brandy has a slightly different fur pattern, complete with light orange, brown and cream fur, cream feet, hands, eyebrows, back spots, right side of the body and head, a strip in her shoulders, right arm and tail end, light orange back, knees, start of the tail, inner ears and forehead, and brown left side of the head and outer ears.
Prior to Onesies, Brandy and her sister hadn't met face-to-face in four years.
Throughout the episode Onesies, it is heavily implied that Brandy has fertility problems, meaning that she may not be able to have children of her own, which may have caused her and Chilli's argument prior to Bluey's Big Play.
Her last name is confirmed to be "Cattle" due to a movie poster art of Onesies done by Nick Rees (a lead background artist for the show).[1]

Script.jpg
The episode starts at the Heeler household, in the late evening.

Bandit: "Big sleep tonight, kids! The easter bunny's coming!"

Chilli: "I wonder how many eggs he'll leave you in your easter pouches!"

Bingo: "How do we know he won't forget us again?"

Bluey: "Yeah, like he did last year!"

Chilli: "Look, we've been through this. He didn't forget you! He was just late. He explained it all in his letter, remember?"

The shot moves to Bandit, who reads a note left on the wall from last Easter.

Bandit: "Dear Bluey and Bingo, so sorry I was late with your easter eggs. I had some family stuff on. I won't go into it. Big love, easter bunny. See? He was just busy!"

The Pups: "Okay."

Chilli: "We promise he won't forget this time."

Bandit and Chilli exit. Before she does however, she knocks over a bottle of confetti.

Chilli: "Oh goodness!"

Bandit: "Eh, we'll clean it up in the morning."

Chilli: "Night kids!"

Chilli and Bandit leave.

Bingo: "Bluey!"

Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo?"

Bingo: "Why did the easter bunny only forget us?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

Bingo: "Do you think he'll remember us this time?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I do! Night, Bingo."

Bluey goes to sleep and Bingo stares up at the ceiling.

EPISODE TITLE: Easter

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Easter."

The shot cuts to Bluey waking up in the morning. She suddenly sits up.

Bluey: "It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!"

Bingo is startled and falls out of bed.

Bingo: "Did he come!?"

Bluey checks her easter pouch on her bed.

Bluey: "I'm not sure. I can't see any eggs!"

Bingo goes to check hers as well.

Bingo: "Mine's empty too! He forgot us again!"

Bluey: "Wait!"

Bingo: "What is it?"

Bingo runs over to Bluey, who pulls out a rainbow box out of her easter pouch, the only item in there.

Bluey: "It's a box!"

Bingo: "Eeee, the egg must be inside!"

Bluey opens the box and turns it over, only to find it empty.

Bluey: "It's empty!"

Bingo: "Awwww...."

Bluey: "Let's check yours again!"

Bluey & Bingo run over to the latter's bed, as Bingo reaches into her easter pouch and pulls out the letter B.

Bingo: "There is something! Oh, it's just a buh. He doesn't care about us!"

Discouraged, Bingo sits down with a saddened expression.

Bluey: "He does, Bingo! I think these are clues to where he's hidden our easter eggs!"

Bluey examines the items and tries to think of what it could mean.

Bluey: "Ooh, I know! Letter, box!

The Pups: "Letterbox!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo, who are speeding down the hallways with the easter pouches strapped to their backs. They run down the stairs and outside to the letterbox.

Bingo: "Are the eggs in there?"

Bluey: "No, just a chatterbox."

Bingo: "Is it from the easter bunny!?"

Bluey: "It is! Look!"

Bingo squeals and Bluey tries solving it.

Bluey: "Easter...egg! Hmmm...what's your favorite color?"

Bingo: "Blue, like you!"

Bluey lifts up the blue colored flap on the chatterbox, and shows a picture of the easter egg and a chef hat.

Bluey: "It's a cook's hat, with an egg!"

Bingo: "What does it mean?"

Bluey: "Well, cooks work in the kitchen...maybe the easter eggs are in the kitchen!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

The two laugh and run back inside the house.

Bingo: "The easter bunny knows my favorite color!"

Bluey: "I told you he cares about you!"

The pups run into the kitchen, where Bandit and Chilli are.

Bandit: "Happy Easter-- hey!"

Chilli: "Hey!"

Bluey and Bingo scramble to find the easter eggs, pushing Bandit and Chilli out of the way.

Bluey: "Sorry mum, we're looking for the easter eggs! They could be anywhere..."

Bingo: "Bluey look, it's an egg!"

Bingo points at the front of the refrigerator, where various fridge magnets and letters are shaped to form an easter egg.

The Pups: "Whoa..."

Bingo opens the fridge, and Bluey squeals excitedly, believing their hunt to be over. However, they find nothing.

Bluey: "Ah, they're not in here."

Bingo: "Awww..."

Bluey: "Wait, look at the normal eggs!"

Bingo: "Oh? The Easter Bunny doesn't bring normal eggs. He brings chocolate eggs!"

Bluey: "I know, but look at the end one!"

The camera zooms in on the "egg" that stands out from the rest, at the end of the carton.

Bingo: "Huh? One egg is a kiwi! Maybe there's chocolate inside!"

The shot cuts to Bandit, as Bluey and Bingo run to him.

Bluey: "Dad, is there chocolate in this?"

Bandit: "Let's see!"

Bluey gives Bandit the kiwi, who promptly cuts in half. However, its only a normal kiwi.

Bandit: "No, no chocolate."

Bingo: "Aww..."

Bluey thinks hard on what it could mean, being a potential clue for the easter eggs' true location.

Bluey: "I think I know where the eggs are!"

The pups run to the living room, where the kiwi rug resides.

Bluey: "The kiwi rug!"

Bingo: "I'll look under it!"

Bluey: "Hmm...I can't see them."

Bingo: "Aww...Maybe the easter bunny just likes other children more than me."

Bluey: "No, Bingo, he likes you! It's just that..-"

Bingo: "Ah, look!"

Bingo points to the kiwi rug, where they spot an arrow.

Bluey: "It's an arrow!"

Bingo: "It's pointing to the backyard!"

Bluey: "Come on!"

The pups run outside into the backyard, where they split up to find it.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo checks the sand castle, and Bluey runs to examine another area.

Bingo: "I don't remember that sand castle."

Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Are the poinsettia flowers normally in a straight line?

Bingo: "Hmm...Usually they're more higgledy piggledy."

Bluey: "I think it's a picture."

Bingo: "A picture of what?"

Bluey: "I don't know! But I know how to find out, come on!"

The pups run up the stairs onto the top of the second floor deck. They go to check the poinsettia petals.

Bluey: "Wow."

Bingo: "It's a castle! Our eggs must be in the castle!"

Bluey: "There's a castle in London! We've gotta get to the airport!"

Bingo: "No, Bluey! I think it's a different castle!"

The shot cuts back to the sand castle in the backyard.

Bingo: "I think it's this one!"

Bluey bashes straight into the castle, destroying it. Afterwards, she begins digging a hole into the sand, squealing in excitement.

Bluey: "I hit something!"

Bingo: "Is it chocolate!?"

Bluey: "It is, it is!"

Bingo squeals. Have they finally found the easter eggs?

Bluey: "Wait...it isn't. It's toilet paper."

Bingo: "Awww!"

Bluey: "Hang on, look! Eggs! It's another clue! Come on!"

Bluey runs off, with Bingo following. She falls into the hole Bluey dug, and giggles. The shot cuts to the bathroom, where they begin looking again.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo: "There's no eggs in here!"

Bluey: "There must be! Toilet paper belongs in the toilet! Unless...Oh, no!"

Bingo: "What?"

Bluey: "They might be in Dad's toilet!"

The pups gasp, with the camera zooming in on their fearful faces. The shot then cuts to Bandit on the toilet. Bluey and Bingo peek in.

Bandit: "Ugh...Bandit!"

Bluey: "Augh, it stinks!"

Bingo: "How are we gonna find the next clue?"

Bluey: "Someone has to go in there!"

Bingo: "But it stinks so much we'll die!"

Bluey: "I know!"

Bingo: "Aww...there will be no Easter."

Bluey: "Yes there will be, Bingo. I'm going in!"

Bluey enters the bathroom, holding her breath.

Bluey: "Ugh, it stinks. I can't...do it..."

She falls to the ground, before she suddenly pops back up.

Bluey: "Wait!"

She looks at the mirror, where a drawing of Bluey and Bingo's bedroom window is present. The shot then cuts back to Bluey exiting the bathroom, coughing and catching a breath of fresh air.

Bingo: "Did you find it?"

Bluey gives Bingo a small note with a drawing of the window.

Bingo: "Oh, I know what this is!"

The shot cuts to the pups running into their bedroom. Bingo runs up to the window and holds the note over it.

Bingo: "It's our window! They must be in here!"

Bluey: "But we've already looked here! I don't understand!"

Bingo: "I do. He forgot us again."

Bingo sits down, discouraged. Bluey accepts defeat and sits down with her.

Bluey: "Maybe you're right, Bingo."

Bingo: "It's my fault, Bluey. I'm just a small, forgettable child."

Bluey: "No you're not, Bingo! You're a great child!"

Bingo: "Really?"

Bluey: "Yes, you're smart! You figured out the castle clue all by yourself!"

Bingo: "Yeah, I did!"

Bluey: "It's me who's forgettable."

Bingo: "You are not! You're brave! You went into Dad's stinky toilet!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, I did!"

Bluey stands back up.

Bluey: "We're not forgettable!"

Bingo: "Yeah, we're rememberable!

The pups hug each other.

Bingo: "Happy easter, Bluey."

Bluey: "Happy easter, Bing-oooh! Look!"

Bluey points to the easter decorations on the carpet. They're formed to resemble footprints.

Bingo: "Footprints! Bunny footprints!"

The Pups: "Easter Bunny footprints!"

The two squeal excitedly, running to follow the path. The path leads them to Bandit's workroom, where a lamp is set up right above the yoga ball. As Bluey moves the ball aside, they have finally found the easter basket, full of chocolates and other goodies.

Bingo: "He remembered us!"

END CREDITS

The credits music is a soft and peaceful resolution to the episode's main soundtrack, which has been building up to the hunt for the easter baskets all this time.

Chippy is often seen sporting sunglasses on the top of his head. He also has a black tiger face tattoo on his right upper arm and a cherry tattoo on his left upper arm.

Chippy is one of the few characters in the Blueyverse that wears clothes, however, they are work clothes, so he likely doesn't wear it at all times.

Chippy is seen getting a lift from Cherry or Sparky
It is implied that Chippy probably lost his driving license from either doing something silly with his car or Driving Under the Influence (DUI)

AD
Appearance
Chunky Chimp is a pink-and-tan monkey with a tan patch on his stomach and around his entire face. His ears and part of his legs and arms are also tan. The rest of his body is pink. Chunky has a round nose with two nostrils that are (compared to the size of the nose) are small. He has two dark-magenta eyebrows.

Personality
As seen as in the episode he stars in, he is inventive, and his curiosity led him to go to the “groundlands”, which is just really the ground. As noted by the Magic Pinecone, he shows bravery.

Biography
Not much is known about his family or friends. One of his friends(?) can be seen up in a tree with him during the start of the Chunky Chimp movie.

Trivia
The animals in the Chunky Chimp movie are some of the only anthropomorphic animals to not be a dog.
Chutney Chimp appears to be a separate franchise with a confusingly similar name.
In the 'Bluey's Bus' playset, the Bluey and Bingo figures are wearing Chunky Chimp shirts, and the back of the bus features an advertisement for the movie.

Administrators notes
There is a current controversy on the name of this character from the mentions and dubbing during season 1-2. On the current Australian showings the name is different, so the determining factor will be resolved with the worldwide release of season 3, the name will be either corrected or left as is when that happens.
