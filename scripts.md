Army
Jack: Mum!

Jack's mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!

Jack's mum: How was your first day at your new school?

Jack: Good.

Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.

Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.

Jack's dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?

Jack: Yes, Dad.

Jack's dad: Did you remember your hat?

Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?

Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!

(goat maahs)

Jack's dad: Jack, your hat?

Jack: I forgot it.

Jack's dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?

Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!

Jack's dad: Jaaaack.

Jack: Sorry, I forgot.

Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?

Jack: I don't know.

Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.

Calypso: Well, hello.

Calypso: You must be my new student.

Jack: I'm Jack.

Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.

Jack: Grr!

Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there. (the red kelpie Calypso is referring to is Rusty)

Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!

Jack's dad: You have fun, mate!

Jack: I will!

Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.

Jack: What are you playing?

Rusty: I'm playing army.

Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.

Jack: Can I be in the army?

Rusty: Well, maybe.

Rusty: Can you do as you're told?

Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...

Rusty: Attention!

Jack: Ah!

Rusty: On the left! Quick march!

Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: On the right!

Rusty: March! Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: Salute!

Rusty: Yeah, you can play.

Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.

Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier.

Rusty: You have to go through basic training.

Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.

Rusty: That's me.

Jack: Oh. Ok.

Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?

Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.

Rusty: You can use my spare.

Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.

Jack: Yes sergeant.

Rusty: Hup!

Jack: Hup!

(both laugh)

Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.

Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.

Rusty: Stop!

(Jack showing hand signals)

Jack: This one means "stop!"

Jack: This means "get down!"

Jack: This is "move over there."

(Jack stops showing hand signals)

Jack: Ha!

Coco: I'll get it! Huh?

Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.

Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.

Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.

Jack: Also, everything had a name.

Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.

Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.

Rusty: That blue gem is called Tango Seven.

Rusty: You got that?

Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.

Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.

Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.

Jack: A dust-off?

Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.

Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.

Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.

Jack: Grunts (while doing push-ups)

Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.

Jack: It's when you're a guard.

Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.

Jack: I loved it.

Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.

Jack: I was really good at sentry.

Rusty: You're really good at sentry.

Jack: Thanks, Sarge.

Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.

Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.

Jack: How do you know so much about the army?

Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.

Jack: Is he on patrol like us?

Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.

Jack: Oh, that's good.

Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.

Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!

Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.

(Rustling in grass)

(Rusty gasps)

(Rustling continues)

Rusty: Contact!

Jack: What do we do?

Rusty: Fall back!

(Both say Arrgh)

(Turkey gobbles)

Rusty: Get down!

(Jack grunts)

Rusty: There's too many of them!

Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!

Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.

Rusty: (speaking into a dotted cylindrical object) Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded!

Rusty: Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?

Jack: It was all down to me.

Jack: I had to remember what that tree was called.

Jack: Tango Five?

Jack: No, Tango Six?

Jack: Tango Seven!

Rusty: (speaking into object once again) We're next to Tango Seven, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven.

Rusty: LZ is no good!

Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.

Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!

Jack: How?

Rusty: Run!

Jack: One thing I can do is run.

Jack: I'm a Jack Russell!

(Jack zooms by Rusty)

Rusty: Whoa!

Rusty: Get to the chopper!

Jack: Ok!

Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.

Jack: We made it!

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

(Both laugh)

Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.

Rusty: Why did you come to this school?

Rusty: Was there something wrong with your old school.

Jack: No.

Jack. There's something wrong with me.

Jack: I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.

Rusty: Oh.

Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.

Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso.

Rusty: You're all safe.

Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.

Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.

Jack: I was in the army.

Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.

Jack: And then it was pick-up time.

Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.

Jack: And now I'm here.

Jack's mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.

Jack: Yeah.

Jack's mum: Good boy, Jack.

Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?

Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?

Jack: Rusty gave it to me.

Rusty: See you, Jack!

Rusty's dad: Hey! Rusty!

Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.

Asparagus
Bingo, Bandit, Bluey, and Chilli are eating dinner in the dining room. Bluey is loudly chewing with her mouth open.

Bluey: (chewing) Agh! Agh! Glargh!

Bluey points at Bingo with her fork.

Bluey: (incomprehensible with her mouth full) Bla-bl-bl-blah, bl-bloo!

Bandit: Bluey, don't talk with your mouth full and sit up straight, don't slouch, it's bad manners.

Bingo: (with mouth full) Is this bad manners? Blaaaaaaaah.

Bingo sticks out her tongue, with a wad of chewed food on it.

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: (giggles)

Bluey: Mum, why do we have to have manners?

Bandit: Because we're not animals.

Chili: I'm happy as long you eat your veggies.

Bandit: Hey, hey, hey! Elbows off the table, thanks Mum.

Chili: (scoffs) Ha!

Bandit: Can you believe that, kids? Ha!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggles)

Chili: (whispering) Psst, Bluey, take this, it's a magic asparagus.

Bluey: What does it do?

Chili: It turns people into any animal you want!

Bluey: For real life?

Chili: For real life.

Chilli hands Bluey the asparagus.

Bluey: Ooooh!

Bandit: Don't play with your food! Blu--

Bluey: (pointing the asparagus like a magic wand) Donkey!

Bandit gets down on his hands and knees.

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw!

Others: (laughter)

Bluey: It worked!

Bandit: Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bingo: Do me! Do me!

Bluey: Okay. Warthog!

Bingo: No, no, I want to be a piglet.

Bluey: Piglet!

Bingo snorts, then jumps down from the chair and begins to run around the room on all fours.

Bingo: (imitating a pig) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Eeee! Eee!

Chilli: Now that's taken care of, I need you to do a little something for me.

Bluey: Chicken!

Chilli stands up so quickly she knocks over her chair, holding her arms like wings.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Ba-kaw!

TITLE CARD: Asparagus

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Asparagus.

END TITLE CARD

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo enter the kitchen together, still doing their animal impressions. Bluey runs in after them.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Bawk! Bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk!

Bingo: (imitating a piglet) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bluey: Elephant!

Bandit stands up, and holds his arm in front of his face like a trunk. Bingo runs through his legs and offscreen.

Bandit: (imitating an elephant) Vrooooo! Vrooooo!

Bluey: I love this!

Bingo runs through the scene, still imitating a piglet.

Bingo: Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bluey: Here, chook, chook, chook!

Chilli: (approaching with a chicken walk) Bawk-bawk-bawk, braawk!

Bluey: Goat!

Chilli gets down on hands and knees. She's drawn with buck teeth and a shorter tail.

Chilli: (imitating a goat) N-e-eh! N-e-eh!

Chilli walks offscreen, and Bingo runs through the scene again

Bluey: Now, be free, my animal friends. No more rules for anyone.

Bingo runs through the scene again, and this time there's a crashing noise from offscreen. The camera pans over to show Bingo digging through a cupboard. Potato chips and a can of beans are spilled on the floor.

Bluey: Aaah! Pig Bingo, you're making a mess!

Bluey grabs Bingo by the waist and drags her out of the cupboard. Bingo struggles as Bluey tries to hold her down.

Bluey: Come here you wriggly little--

Bandit enters from offscreen and picks Bluey up with his "trunk". Bingo immediately dives back into the cupboard.

Bandit: Vroooo!

Bluey: Aaaaaah! Put me down! Aaah! Meerkat!

Bandit stands up on his tiptoes, arms held in front of him.

Bandit: (imitating a meerkat) Um-dum-dum! Hey! Hey!

Bluey: You can't just grab people and swing them around!

Bandit scampers to the fridge on all fours, then stands up to look around.

Bandit: Hey, hey!

Back on all fours, Bandit scampers out of the room.

Bluey: (laughs)

A dog toy squeaks from offscreen. The camera pans, and shows Chilli leaning on the kitchen counter, nibbling on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Polly Puppy! Mouse!

Chilli gets down on all fours and makes herself as small as she can.

Chilli: (imitating a mouse) Squeeeeak!

Bluey: You can't chew people's toys!

Chilli scratches her ear.

Bluey: It's not nice!

Chilli: Squeak! Squeak!

Bingo runs into the scene again, with an open bag of chips in her mouth.

Bingo: Eee!

Bluey: Penguin!

Bingo drops the chips, stands up straight with her arms at her sides and begins to waddle around.

Bingo: (imitating a penguin) De-de-de-de, de-de-de!

Bluey: (groans) This is hard work.

Bandit pops up from behind the kitchen counter.

Bandit: Um-dum-dum!

The scene changes to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo in, still doing their animal impressions.

Bluey: Maybe I'll turn you into slightly calmer animals. Peacocks!

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo stand up, lean forward, and hold their arms behind them.

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo: (imitating peacocks) Prrrrr. Prrrrr. Prrrr. Rrrrr.

Bluey sits down on a chair.

Bluey: Ahh. That's a bit better.

Bandit snaps open a paper fan held behind him, imitating a peacock's tail.

Bandit: Prrrr-rrrr. Prrrr. Prrrr.

Bandit smugly waves his "tail" in Chilli and Bingo's faces. Chilli looks annoyed, Bingo looks confused.

Chilli and Bingo: Prrr. Prrrr.

Bluey: Hey, mind your manners, Mr. Show-Off!

Bandit struts, getting closer to Chilli and Bingo, who both look worried now.

Bandit: PRRRRR! Prrrr!

Bluey gets up and runs in between them. She pushes Bandit back a few steps.

Bluey: Okay, you asked for it. Lions!

Chilli and Bingo get down on all fours, adopting fierce expressions.

Chilli: (imitating a lion) Roaaaar!

Bingo: (imitating a lion) Rar!

Bandit jumps backwards a step.

Bandit: (worried) Prrrr!

Bluey: (laughs) That will teach you to show off!

Chilli and Bingo lunge at Bandit, and chase him out into the yard.

Chilli: Roaaaar!

Bingo: Rar! Rar!

Bandit: Prrrrr!

Bluey: Nooooo! Don't go outside!

The scene changes to the yard, at the base of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: (panting) Where'd they go!

Bandit: Prrrr!

The camera pulls back to show Bandit has climbed up onto the lowest branch of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: There you are! Walrus!

Bandit falls out of the tree.

Bandit: Aaaaah! Oof! (groans)

The camera pulls back to show the whole yard. Bandit is now laying on his stomach. He blinks one eye and then the other.

Bluey: Now, where are those lions?

The camera pans to show Lucky's Dad's yard, which is partially un-mowed. The un-mowed portion has waist-high grass. Pat is is singing while hanging shirts on a drying rack.

Pat: (singing) One Sunday morning as I went walking/By Brisbane waters, I chanced to--

A twig snaps.

Pat: Oh! What was that?

The camera cuts to show Chilli and Bingo, hiding in the tall grass.

Chilli and Bingo: (growling) Mmmmmmmmm. Graar!

The camera cuts back to Pat.

Pat: Is that you, Lucky?

The camera cuts to a wide shot of the yard. Chilli and Bingo are not visible. The only sound is crickets chirping.

Pat: Oh, well, I guess it's nothing.

Chilli and Bingo pounce from the tall grass, tackling Pat around the legs.

Chilli and Bingo: Roaaaar!

Pat: Aaaah!

The camera cuts back to Bluey and Bandit. Bandit is now doing a walrus impression, holding himself up on his arms and with two protruding teeth like tusks. He continues blinking his eyes one at a time. Bluey is down on all fours, presumably trying to tell him something.

Pat: (continues screaming from offscreen) Janelle!

Bluey gets up and runs out of frame.

Bandit: (imitating a walrus) Mwoaaaar!

The camera cuts back to Pat's yard. Chilli and Bingo are gnawing on Pat's ankles and dragging him into the tall grass. He's digging his fingers into the ground to stay put but it's not helping.

Pat: Oh, Mrs. Heeler! Oh, I don't know about this! Aah!

Bluey emerges from the tall grass.

Bluey: Parrot!

Bingo crouches down and folds her arms at her sides like wings. Chilli continues to chew on Pat's ankle.

Bingo: (imitating a parrot) Squawk!

Bluey: Bunny!

Chilli crouches down with her arms in front of her.

Chilli: (imitating a rabbit) (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Polly want a cracker?

Pat crawls to the safety of the drying rack, panting.

Bluey: Get back in the house, you two!

Bluey herds Bingo and Chilli back towards their yard.

Bluey: Sorry Lucky's Dad!

Pat: No worries Bluey. (sounding ashamed) I shouldn't have let my guard down.

The scene changes back to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bingo, and Bandit into the room.

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Get in here, you lot!

Chilli: (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: That's it! You animals need to learn some manners.

Bandit butts his head into Bluey's shoulder.

Bandit: Rohh!

Bluey: Aah! Daddy Walrus! No doing that thing!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: First manners is...

Bingo: Polly want a cracker.

Bluey: (pointing at Bingo) Oh! First is, don't speak when someone's speaking!

Bingo: (sadly) Squawk.

Bluey: Second manners is...

Chilli: (clicks her tongue)

Chilli wanders off, hopping like a bunny.

Bluey: Hey! Worm!

Chilli stretches out and starts writhing from side to side.

Chilli: (imitating a worm) Eee! Mmmmmn! Mmmmn!

Bluey: No running away from manners lessons! Now, third one is... don't eat the next-door neighbors. That's a really important one. Hey, where's Daddy Walrus?

Bandit is missing. Bluey gasps, and Bandit grunts from offscreen. The camera cuts to the corner of the playroom, where Bandit is squatting on the rug in in front of a dollhouse, a look of intense concentration on his face.

Bluey: Nooooo!

Bluey puts her hands on her face as she screams, causing her to toss the asparagus, which lands by Bingo. Bluey runs out of frame towards Bandit.

Bingo: (looking at the asparagus) Squawk!

The scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey in the corner. Bandit is squinting with effort. Bluey runs in between him and the dollhouse, and pushes him away.

Bandit: (grunts)

Bluey: Fourth manners is--

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: don't go to the toilet on the rug!

Bluey pushes him back to the others. Bingo is chewing on the asparagus.

Bluey: (groans with effort) You big grub!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: This is hopeless. I'm gonna turn you all back into dogs. Where's my asparagus?

Bingo: (indistinctly) Polly want a cracker!

Bingo swallows the asparagus whole.

Bluey: Noooooooo!

Bluey runs over to Bingo, and pries her jaws open as far as she can.

Bingo: Daaaaah.

Bluey lets Bingo close her mouth.

Bluey: Oh, no! You're stuck like this forever!

Bandit headbutts Bluey in the shoulder again.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bingo: Squawk! Polly want more asparagus!

Bluey: Wait! I've got an idea!

The scene cuts to a close-up of Bingo, still imitating a parrot, seated at the dinner table.

Bingo: Squawk!

The camera cuts back to reveal Bandit, slumped over and barely on his chair, with Bluey supporting most of his weight. Chilli is sitting upright in her chair, but only because she's been tied in place with a jump rope.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: Okay, Bird Bingo, you've eaten the magic asparagus. Too late to change that. But I think if you say "doggie," everyone will turn back to doggies.

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: Can you say "Polly want a doggie"? Pretty please?

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Chilli: Mmmmn!

Bingo: Polly want a cracker!

Bluey: Ugh! No, "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit slaps Bluey with his "flipper".

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! Hands to yourself, Daddy Walrus! Come on, Bird Bingo! "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey manages to push Bandit upright in his chair.

Bluey: Oof!

Bandit, balanced precariously, teeters for a moment.

Bandit: Mwoar!

Bandit overbalances and falls out of his chair.

Bluey: Ugh!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey runs over and starts trying to lift Bandit into his chair again.

Bluey: Urgh! Come on, Bird Bingo! It's hard to get a walrus...

Bluey gets Bandit back into his chair.

Bluey: ...to sit at the dinner table!

Bingo: Polly want a... d... d...

Bluey: Yeah, yeah!

Bingo: Dinosaur!

Bandit and Chilli hold their arms in front of their chests like a T-Rex and snarl. Chilli is still tied to her chair.

Bandit and Chilli: (imitating a dinosaur) Roaaar! Roaaar!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, no! Doggie, doggie!

Bluey shakes Bingo for a second, before Bandit picks Bluey up and pretends to chomp on her stomach.

Bandit: Roaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! No eating your manners teacher!

Bandit: (still chomping) Raar! Raar!

Bluey: (screams)

Bingo: Polly want a...

Bluey: Help!

Bingo: Polly want a... doggie!

With a jerk, Bandit and Chilli return to normal.

Chilli: Huh?

Bluey: Hooray! You did it, Bird Bingo!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bandit: What's going on?

Bluey: Uh...

Chilli: (untying herself) Oh, uh... We're just eating dinner. Remember?

Bandit: Ah, yeah -- dinner. Okay, well, make sure you --

Bluey eats her last two pieces of broccoli in one bite.

Bluey: (formally) I've finished my vegetables, Father. I shall now excuse myself to go tidy the kitchen.

Bluey pushes in her chair and clears away her dishes. She winks at Chilli on the way past, and Chilli winks back.

Bluey: Pip, pip!

Bandit: Well. That's more like it.

Bingo: (still imitating a parrot) Squawk! Bawk, bawk, bawk!

Bingo pecks at her food, causing the plate to rattle loudly.

Bandit: Bingo, for the last time, use a knife and --

Bingo: Chicken!

Bandit stands bolt upright and holds his arms like wings.

Bandit: (imitating a chicken): Ba-kaw!

BBQ

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Chilli [angrily from off]: Whose muddy footprints are these?!

Cut to Bingo using the mop to clean up her footprints. Later, Muffin and Socks have cleared the salad and dressing off the bench to make way for Bluey's "sausages".

Muffin: More sausages please, Bluey.

Bluey: Here you go.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Bandit: Out of the way, salads!

Bandit pushes the salad bowls aside to make room for the sausages. Everyone except Bingo and Bandit starts complimenting Bandit on the sausages.

Bandit: Why thank you. Thank you very much.

Bingo, however, is frustrated.

Bingo [annoyed]: Isn't anyone going to mention the salads??

Pause. Everyone looks around nervously, before starting to praise Chilli and her salads.

Chilli [laughing]: Thank you, thank you.

They all laugh, Stripe affectionately rubbing the top of Bingo's head. Chilli hugs Bingo.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

Bluey: Mum, am I better at the monkey bars than Bingo?

Chilli: Well, you are two years older than her, Bluey.

Bluey: Am I better than Judo?

Chilli: You're about the same as Judo.

Bluey: I'm not! Judo cant do skip bar or backwards one bar.

Chilli: Well, she'll get there one day.

Bluey: But am I better than her on this day?

Chilli: Bluey, just run your own race.

Bluey: Huh? What does that mean?

Chilli: Come here. Have I told you the story of when you took your first steps?

Bluey: Oh, no!

Chilli: Well, it all started when you were still a baby.

(The camera shows a baby version of Bluey. She is wearing a red nappy and is lying on the floor, drooling on the rug, making baby noises)

(Bandit is also here too and he is drooling like Baby Bluey, Chilli is then see holding a baby rattle to catch Baby Bluey's attention.)

Chilli: Come on, Bluey. Roll over. Rollover! (Baby Bluey stops drooling, sees her mom and rolls over to one side)

Chilli (present): You learned to roll over really early. (Baby Bluey coos as we see a first person view of herself.)

Chilli (past): BANDIT!!! She rolled over!! She rolled over!! She's not meant to do that for ages!!

Bandit: Aw, that's my girl!

(Baby Bluey pushes Bandit to the side, she then laughs)

Bingo: Hang on, where was I?

Chilli: You weren't born yet, sweetheart.

Bingo: Ooh, I was invisible!

Bluey: Were you proud of me for rolling over so soon?

Chilli: Yes. A little too proud. (The camera goes to Nana's house. Bandit is seen dragging Baby Bluey to change her nappy while Nana and Chilli have some tea). I think I may have turned into a bit of a show off.

Nana: Oh, I've never heard of a baby rolling over that early!

Chilli (past): I know!

Nana: She's just special.

Bandit (past):(he coughs, the camera goes to mothers group where we see baby versions of Coco, Snickers and Judo. All of them are looking at their mums happily while making sounds. )

Chilli: But then one day at Mothers' Group...

Chilli (past): It is very early to roll over.

Bella: Oh, you're so clever, Bluey! (The look to their right and noticed something. We pan to see Snickers and Judo. Judo is the one who is sitting up while Snickers is seen laying down on the ground)

Wendy: Woah! She's sitting, She's sitting! Oh, Judo, you're sitting all by yourself! (Baby Judo giggles)

Snickers' mum: Oh, goodness, that's very early to be sitting!

Wendy: Oh, well, you know, it's not a race.

Bluey: But it was a race.

Bingo: A baby race!

(Episode title card)

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Baby Race.

(We go to another flashback. Chilli is seen holding Baby Bluey in her hands while Bandit is seen working on something)

Chilli: I don't know what got into me, but I was determined I'd get you walking before Judo's mum...I mean, Judo.

Chilli (past): There you go...steady...Bandit! She's sitting!

Bandit (past): Huh? Ack!

Chilli (past): Good gi-ah! (Baby Bluey suddenly falls down on the ground. She laughs very loudly)

(We go back to mother's group. This time the babies are sitting up, just like Baby Bluey).

Chilli: But after a lot of practice, eventually, you set up.

Bella: Bluey, you're sitting!

Baby Bluey: (she laughs, the two noticed Judo again. This time she is crawling while Wendy tries to catch up with her)

Wendy: Judo! Oh, goodness, I just can't keep track of her!

Baby Bluey: (mumbles, she then falls and laughs)

Bluey: Judo crawled before me as well?!

Bingo: Judo beat you again!

Bluey: And just what did you do about this?

Chilli: Well, I tried my best.

Bandit (past)(background): This thing is heavy!

Chilli (past):(claps) Come on, Bluey, crawl to Mama! You can do it, you can do it!

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did Bluey crawl?

(Baby Bluey rolls across the floor, she then laughs again)

Chilli: Not exactly.

Bluey:(laughs) Why was I rolling?

Chilli: I don't know, kid. You didn't come with instructions.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just roll before they crawl.

(Baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton dog and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Bandit (past)(background)(singing): 99 bottles of thing on the wall...

Chilli (past): Aha!

(Cut to living room area)

Chilli (past): It's fun to crawl. (Baby Bluey giggles as she sees this) Oh, how good is crawling? It's better than rolling.

Bandit (past): (falls on Bluey's toy) YOW! My knees! Baby Bluey laughs very loudly)

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Chilli: Not exactly.

Chilli (past): Come on, Bluey! You can do it! Crawl to me!

(Baby Bluey looks like she's going to crawl, but then bum shuffles to Chilli as she giggles to her)

Bandit (past): Woo hoo, yeah! Bum shuffle!

Bluey: Bum shuffle?!

Chilli: Bum shuffle.

(Cut to Mothers' Group where Baby Bluey is seen bum shuffling to meet her baby friends)

Chilli: You were a bum shuffler.

(As Baby Bluey bum shuffles, Coco is seen crawling to the right and to the left, Snickers is about to crawl, but he sees Baby Bluey bum shuffling and Judo is seen getting on top of a stool)

Bella: Woo hoo! Go Bluey!

Chilli: Meanwhile, Judo was pulling herself up on furniture, which is the step right before walking.

Bluey: And I was just bum shuffling around?!

Bingo: You are definitely not winning the baby race.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just bum shuffle before they crawl.

(Again, baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Chilli (past): See, feels good, doesn't it? Feels like you wanna crawl, right?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Mum: Yes!!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!!

Chilli: Backwards! (Baby Bluey suddenly crawls backwards as she giggles)

Bandit (past): (laughs) Beep, beep, beep!

(Bingo laughs while Bluey facepalms)

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about. (Baby Bluey giggles again)

(Cut to Nana's house)

Chilli: But Nana wasn't having that.

Nana: Let's stop mucking around, eh? A bit of olive oil on those knees will do the trick.

Chilli (past): But how is olive oil gonna-oh my goodness!

Bandit (past): Mum, what are you doing?!

Nana: If she can't crawl, she'll have to walk.

Bandit (past): This isn't legal anymore!

Nana: I'll sprinkle some grit down, too. Oh, where'd they go?

(Bluey and Bingo laugh)

Chilli: Your Nana's old school.

(Cut to Mothers' Group, this time the Babies, expect for Bluey, who is still crawling backwards are walking. Baby Snickers suddenly falls on his butt.)

Chilli: None of it mattered, though. Judo had won the baby race.

(Cut to present)

Bingo: Oh, biscuits.

Bluey: Were you upset with me that I lost the baby race?

Chilli: No, sweetie. Look, we were all learning to do things for the first time.

(Cut to balcony)

Chilli: I just felt like I was doing everything wrong.

Bandit (past): Aren't you going to Mothers' Group?

Chilli (past): (sighs)

(Cut to Mothers' Group. While Wendy and Snicker's mum talk about the hat that Snickers usually wears, Baby Coco makes a sound, shocking and distracting Bella.)

Snickers' mum: It's a cute hat, It's kinda like he was born with it.

(Cut to porch. Bella is seen holding her purse and Baby Coco as Baby Bluey plays with leaves.)

Chilli: But then, one day, Coco's mum came to see me.

Bella: Hi, Chilli.

Chilli (past): Bella! Oh, hello. I'm so sorry, the house is a mess.

Chilli: We chatted for a while and then she showed me a photo.

Chilli (past): Are these all your children?

Bella: Yep!

Chilli (past): I thought Coco was your first.

Bella: No, I've got eight kids! Wait, no. Nine.

Chilli (past): I had no idea! Wow... you must have learned a thing or two.

Bella: I have. And there's something you need to know.

Chilli (past): What?

Bella: You're doing great.

(Chilli tears up and embraces Bella. Cut to present.)

Chilli: (sniffles)

Bingo: Are they happy tears, Mum?

Chilli: (voice breaking) Yeah. Happy tears, honey.

(Cut to living room)

Chilli: From then on, I decided to run my own race.

Chilli (past): Whoa, whoa, whoa, yay! Bluey wins!

(Cut to Mothers' Group, Judo walks up to Chilli as she makes a sound)

Baby Judo: Oobi!

Chilli (past): Well done, Judo, you clever girl! (We show a close up of Baby Judo, there is a pink bow on her head and there are hearts on her diaper.)

Bingo: So, did Bluey ever learn to walk?

Chilli: Yes, honey. In the kitchen, actually.

(Cut to kitchen, Bluey pulls herself up and walks to Chilli)

Bluey: Why did I decide to walk in the kitchen?

Chilli: I don't know, sweetie.

(As the episode nears its end, Chilli sees Baby Bluey walking and reaches to pick her up with tears in her eyes.)

Bingo: Maybe you just saw something you wanted.

The episode starts at Calypso's school. The shot cuts to the main classroom, where all the pups are gathered around by Calypso.

Calypso: "Okay class, something very special is happening today!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "What is it?"

Bluey and Mackenzie look at each other after saying the same thing in unintentional unison. Winton scoots up next to Bluey.

Winton: "Oooh! Bluey's gonna marry Mackenzie!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "No we're not!"

Calypso: "You're going to see your buddies!"

The Pups: "Hooray!"

Calypso: "Now, go to the special place where you meet them."

The pups laugh as they all run off. The shot cuts to Bluey running to her buddy, sitting on a hill resting underneath a tree.

Bluey: "Mia!"

Mia: "Bluey!"

Mia and Bluey hug each other.

Bluey: "Can we build a fairy garden?"

Mia: "Okay, let's go!"

The shot cuts to Mackenzie meeting his buddy.

Mackenzie: "Captain!"

Captain: "Mackenzie!"

The two do a unique handshake.

Mackenzie: "Can we play barky boats?"

Captain: "Okay!"

EPISODE TITLE: Barky Boats

Calypso: "This episode of Bluey is called Barky Boats."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia, who run down the hill, joyfully laughing.

Bluey: "Mia? Can I show you my cartwheel?"

Mia: "Go for it!"

Bluey proceeds to do a cartwheel, impressing Mia.

Mia: "Wow! You've been practicing! Watch mine!"

Mia does her cartwheel, landing in a split.

Bluey: "Whoa!"

Mia: "Come on! I'll race you!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Mia race after one another, heading to the forest where their fairy garden resides. The shot cuts to Mackenzie and Captain sitting by a small pond canal. Mackenzie grabs some wood bark chips scattered about the ground.

Captain: "I'll make the dam!"

Mackenzie: "Here's a good one!"

Captain: "Oh yeah, that'll go fast!"

Just then, Bluey and Mia run by as Mackenzie is busy sharpening a bark chip to refine the shape.

Captain: "Hi Mia. Hi Mia! HI MIA!"

Mia: "Oh! Hi Captain!"

Captain: "What are you up to?"

Mia: "Bluey and I are gonna go build a fairy garden. What are you doing?"

Captain: "We're playing barky boats!"

Mia: "Oh, okay. Have fun. Bye!"

Captain: "Bye, Mia!"

Bluey and Mackenzie stick their tongue out at each other, showing they have a light rivalry with one another. After Bluey and Mia leave, Mackenzie runs back with the barky boat.

Mackenzie: "Okay, let it go!"

Captain moves his hands away from the dam, causing the water to flood out as the barky boat travels down the canal.

Mackenzie & Captain: "Yeah! Look at it go!"

The boat reaches the end, a wave of new water overlapping with the pond at the end of the canal.

Mackenzie: "Again!"

Captain: "Hey, uhh, Mackenzie? Do you wanna help Bluey build a fairy garden?"

Mackenzie: "...No?"

Captain: "Ah, okay."

The shot cuts to Bluey and Mia in the forest, running to a secluded space with a small stream of water running through.

Bluey: "Let's build it here!"

Bluey grabs a log, and Mia grabs a couple leaves.

Bluey: "This can be the bridge."

Mia: "These can be the trees!"

Bluey and Mia do more work on the fairy garden, setting up houses out of the resources around the forest. Mia helps Bluey pick a couple plants off of the trees, and then the shot cuts to a more complete fairy garden.

Bluey: "How old are you?"

Mia: "Twelve!"

Bluey: "Wow. Can you drive a car?"

Mia: "Hehehe! No, not yet!"

Bluey: "When do you start big school?"

Mia: "Next year."

Bluey: "Are you nervous about big school?"

Mia's smile slightly drops into a worried frown.

Mia: "No, it's gonna be great!"

Bluey: "Ooh, can you write words?"

Mia: "Yeah!"

Bluey: "Can you write a letter to the fairies?"

Mia: "Okay, go for it!"

Bluey: "Okay, um. Dear fairies--"

Mackenzie and Captain enter, alerting Bluey and Mia.

Captain: "Hi!"

Bluey: "Aah! Ugh, Mackenzie, what are you doing here?"

Mackenzie: "He made me come!"

Mia: "Explain yourself!"

Captain: "Oh, I...I thought there might be some good bark here for our barky boats."

Bluey: "Well, there's not, now shoo!"

Mackenzie: "I told you! Come on, let's go!"

Mia: "Bye!"

Bluey: "Ugh, that was close! Okay, dear fairies: Dad bought new grass, but it had ants in it, and he couldn't find the ant powder, and Mum was like 'Where'd you last have it?' He said--"

Mia gets sidetracked and pulls up a piece of bark.

Mia: "Oh! Look! Do you think this would make a good barky boat?"

Bluey: "Uhhh, I guess?"

Mia: "Do you just wanna just quickly give it to Mackenzie?"

Bluey: "No!"

Mia: "Come on Bluey, I'll race you!"

Mia runs off, but Bluey hesitantly waits behind, worried she's leaving her behind to hang out with Captain and Mackenzie. The shot cuts back to the two other buddies, playing another round of barky boats.

Mackenzie: "Keep letting the water build up!"

Captain: "Okay."

Mackenzie: "And no running off!"

Captain: "Yeah, okay. I don't know what I was thinking."

Mia enters, alerting the two.

Mia: "Hi!"

Captain: "Aah!"

Captain jumps, scared by Mia's sudden appearance. causing the built-up water to flood out, splashing Mackenzie in the face.

Mackenzie: "Aah!"

Captain: "Sorry, Mackenzie!"

Bluey enters, looking annoyed.

Mackenzie: "What are you doing here?!"

Bluey: "She made me come.."

Mia: "I thought you might like this barky boat?"

Captain: "Aw, thanks! That's a good one!"

Mackenzie: "It's not that good.."

Bluey: "It's gooder than yours!"

Mackenzie: "Is not!"

Mia: "I can find a better one!"

Captain: "I'll help you."

Mia: "Okay!"

Mia & Captain: "We'll be right back!"

The two run off, leaving Bluey and Mackenzie alone.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Awww..."

Some time passes, Bluey and Mackenzie sulk by the barky boats pond. Just then, Calypso enters!

Calypso: "Aw, Bluey! Mackenzie! Where are your buddies?"

Bluey: "They ran away from us!"

Calypso: "Oh, goodness me."

Bluey: "Don't they like us?"

Calypso: "Of course they do! But, it can be hard being twelve years old, sometimes."

Bluey: "What do you mean?"

Calypso: "Here, give me those barky boats. I'll show you something. Go on, hold the water back."

Bluey and Mackenzie both hold the water back, causing it to build up.

Calypso: "There once were two six year-old buddies floating around, nice and calm, not a care in the world! They turned seven years old, then eight years old, then nine, then ten, and eleven, and then...!"

Mackenzie: "I can't hold it any longer!"

Bluey: "Look out!"

The two let go of the dam, causing the water to flood out at high speeds and for the two barky boats to go travelling down.

Calypso: "Twelve! Off they went, on a big adventure! Hang on, buddies!"

Bluey & Mackenzie:' "Yeah, hang on, buddies!"

Calypso: "They went this way, and that way..."

The boats begin to drift due to the surging rush of water, with them coming close to falling out.

Mackenzie: "Aah! Are they gonna make it?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

The barky boats continue down the canal, before finally landing in the pond at the end of the path safely.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Yeah! They made it!"

Calypso: "Hooray!"

Bluey: "And they lived happily ever after."

Calypso: "Just be patient, children. Your buddies haven't forgotten you."

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Okay, Calypso!"

Now back with Captain and Mia, they walk into a empty part of the forest, with a fruit tree.

Mia: "Maybe there's some barky boats around here."

Captain: "Yeah, there usually is."

Mia: "Ooh! Lillie-pillies! Let's pick some for our buddies!"

Captain: "Okay!"

The two pick some lillie-pillies.

Captain: "What's your favorite fruit?"

Mia: "Uhh, lychees! What's yours?"

Captain: "I like mangoes."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mackenzie. Now with Calypso gone they're back to waiting for their buddies to return.

Mackenzie: "Are you going to go back to your fairy garden?"

Bluey: "Uh, no. It's not as much fun without my buddy."

Mackenzie: "Yeah, same...Wanna play barky boats with me?"

Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"

Mackenzie: "We can race our buddies!"

Bluey and Mackenzie ready their barky boats.

Bluey: "Ready? One, two, three, go!"

Mackenzie: "Wooo!"

Bluey: "Go, Mia!"

The shot cuts to Mia and Captain, now lying on the forest floor, resting under the sun.

Mia: "Are you nervous about starting high school?"

Captain: "A little."

Mia: "Me too...at least we'll be there together!"

As the two smile and their tails wag, the shouts of their buddies can be heard in the distance.

Captain & Mia: "Our buddies!"

Bluey: "Noo, Mia won!"

Mackenzie: "No she didn't, Captain won!"

Bluey: "No he didn't!"

Mackenzie: "Yes, he did!"

The two blow raspberries at each other. Soon after they burst into laughter with one another. Mia and Captain run back.

Captain: "We're back!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Hooray!"

Mia: "We're so sorry, Bluey! I don't know what happened..."

Captain: "We were looking for barky boats..."

Mia: "And went down this way, and that way and--"

Captain: "And we found some lillie-pillies, and then I...I don't know what happened!"

Bluey: "That's okay! You made it back!"

Bluey hugs Mia, and Mackenzie does a fist-bump with Captain.

Mia: "Come on Bluey, let's finish the fairy letter!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Before Bluey goes to hop on Mia's back, ready to leave for the fairy garden again, she stops and looks over to Mackenzie and Captain. She runs over to hug Mackenzie.

Bluey: "See 'ya, Mackenzie!"

Mackenzie: "See 'ya, Bluey!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Bluey and Mia leave. Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Captain run back to the barky boats pond.

Captain: "Alright, come on! Let's do the biggest dam ever!"

Mackenzie: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia. The fairy garden is complete, and Mia is ready to continue with Bluey's letter to the fairies.

Mia: "Okay, ready Bluey!"

Bluey: "Dear fairies: Dad bought new grass. It had ants! I love my buddy Mia, cause she can do the splits, and she gives me piggybacks."

Mia: "Oh, I love giving you piggybacks!"

Bluey: "Please get the ants out of Dad's grass, and also look after Mia when she goes to big school, even though she isn't scared."

Mia stops writing, and begins tearing up at Bluey's words and the feeling that she is heading off to high school soon.

Bluey: "And make sure she doesn't forget to come and play with me. Kiss kiss kiss, hug hug h-"

Mia hugs Bluey, with Bluey smiling in return.

Bingo: Ow! Awww... I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again.

Bluey: And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her.

Bandit: (grabs her arm) Hang on, not so fast.

Bandit (offscreen): Let's just see what happens next.

Trivia
This episode is a one-time spin-off of the entire series as it focuses primarily on Bluey's sister, Bingo.
Bingo gets her own title card, intro and outro in this episode. She says "This episode of Bingo is called "Bingo"" instead of "This episode of Bluey is called "Bingo"".
Chilli says “sweet as, Bingo”, in a Kiwi accent, a reference to what country the Kiwi animal lives in.
Bingo breaks the fourth wall when she looks at the camera and tells her answer for "I Spy", which in this case, is a rug.
It is revealed that Bingo loves to eat raspberries and blueberries.
The soundtrack that plays throughout this episode is Mozart's Sonata No. 16.
This episode's inspirational poster is based on a movie poster for Home Alone.
This is the 1st instance of a sound effect in the title card.
Bandit's response "Not again!" to the missing New Zealand piece is a possible reference to the countless times NZ has been left off world maps. Including the game board for Risk™ and on a map in an episode of Star Trek.
Long Dog: This version of the dog is teal with a purple nose and is reading a newspaper. It can be seen on the right side of the screen during the scene where Chilli comforts Bingo in the playroom closet.

Script.jpg
The episode opens in a grassy meadow. Bandit is laying on his back on a picnic blanket. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are approaching him. They have all drawn faces on their right hands, with markers and googly eyes. Bingo's hand is also decorated with a flower crown and feather wings. They walk their fingers over the picnic blanket, using their hands as puppets.

Chilli: Once, there were two sisters:

The episode cuts to an extreme close up on their hands, giving us a puppets-eye view. Chilli's puppet has a frown and worried expression. Bluey's is smiling. Bluey's puppet picks up a fork.

Chilli: [voiceover] Big Sister --

Chilli: (as Big Sister) Hi!

Chilli: [voiceover] And Little Sister.

Bluey: (as Little Sister) Hi!

Bingo: [voiceover] And also, a little fairy.

Chilli: [voiceover] Oh, yes! And also, a little fairy.

Little Sister spins in a circle, flailing her fork.

Little Sister: Eeee!

Big Sister: Whoa! Be careful, Little Sister! You'll have someone's eye out with that thing.

Little Sister drops the fork.

Little Sister: And the Big Sister was no fun at all.

Big Sister: Hey! I'm lots of fun!

Little Sister: Nuh-uh!

Chilli: [voiceover] Anyway, it was winter and very cold.

Big Sister: Brrrr! We need to find somewhere warm to sleep, little sister!

Bingo: (as Little Fairy) I know a place that's got the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Sister: Where are they, Little Fairy?

Little Fairy: Beyond the Blue Mountains!

An extreme low-angle shot of Bandit's feet, knees, and stomach, framing them as a mountain range.

Little Sister: Yay! The Blue Mountains!

TITLE CARD - Blue Mountains

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called the Blue Mountains.

Back to the opening shot, showing whole characters.

Chilli: (as Big Sister) No way are we going to the Blue Mountains.

Cut back to the puppets-eye view.

Big Sister: It's too dangerous!

Little Sister: I told you she was no fun. Race you!

Bingo: (giggles)

Big Sister: Hey!

Little Sister and Little Fairy run off together. They stop when they encounter Bandit's tail.

Little Sister: Whoa, look!

Big Sister hides behind a sandwich.

Big Sister: Stay back, Little Sister! We don't know what that is!

Little Sister: (giggles) Don't worry. It's friendly.

Little Sister briefly lifts up the tail and lets it drop.

Big Sister: Brrr! We'd best get going.

Cut to Bandit's foot. Little Sister and Little Fairy leap onto his foot and begin climbing his leg.

Little sister: Hooray!

Cut to Bandit's shin. Little Sister is skipping backwards up the slope.

Big Sister: This is too steep.

Little sister: Oh, big sister, don't be a stick in the mud.

Cut to Bandit's knee. The girls enjoy a panoramic view.

Big Sister: (gasps)

Little Sister: What a view!

Big Sister: How do we get down?

Little Fairy: We slide! Whee!

Little Sister: Whee!

They both slide down Bandit's thigh. Big sister hesitates.

Big Sister: Okay. Here we goooo!

Big Sister also slides down. We cut back to Chilli.

Chilli: (laughs)

Chilli licks her finger and erases Big Sister's frown, then draws a smile on instead. Back in puppet-vision, Big Sister is sliding down Bandit's thigh.

Big Sister: Whee! Yeah! That was fun!

The three of them are bouncing on Bandit's belly.

Little Sister: It's so soft and squishy!

Big Sister: It _is_ soft and squishy, isn't it, little sister? It's like we're bouncing on a massive pikelet.

Bandit: (growls)

As Bandit growls, the screen shakes and rumbling sound effects suggest an earthquake.

Little Sister: What's happening?

Bandit folds his arms, creating a massive wall across his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Little Sister: How are we gonna get past this big wall?

Big Sister: It's too high to climb!

Little Sister: We'll never find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Fairy: My sweeties, there's a secret spot somewhere here. We just have to find it.

Big Sister: Oh, yes! And if we scratch it, it makes the wall come tumbling down.

Little Sister: Hee, okay!

Big Sister: You try over there.

Little Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs lightly. Big Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs harder. Little Fairy tickles Bandit. He laughs even harder.

Little Sister: This is the spot!

Big Sister and Little Fairy come and tickle the same spot.

Little Fairy: Yeah, that's the spot!

Big Sister: You got it!

Bandit laughs and raises his arms. All three begin running towards his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Big Sister: Run for your lives!

Bandit's arms slam back down behind them.

All: Hooray!

They dance and laugh.

Big Sister: Yeah! Oh, I'm having so much fun, little sister. Maybe I do just need to relax and enjoy myself more. I wonder why I ever stopped in the first place.

Bandit: (offscreen) Well, hello!

Bandit's hand puppet appears. He's stuck a nose and tail on his hand, and drawn pointy ears on his wrist. He's even given his puppet shoes and a monobrow.

Bandit: (as the fox) I am a kindly fox.

Big Sister: Oh, look at this cute little fella.

The Fox: You wouldn't be looking for the warmest, softest beds in the whole world, would you?

Big Sister: We are!

The Fox: Well, you're in luck. I can show you the way.

Big Sister: Oh, great! Did you hear that, kids?

Little Sister: Big sister, I think he's a cheeky fox.

Big Sister: A what?! No, he's a kindly fox. He said so. Ooh, look at his cute little tail.

The camera cuts to the fox doing leg stretches. His right eye falls off, and he puts it back on. When the camera cuts back, Little Sister is frowning.

Little Sister: I'm not so sure.

Big Sister: Oh, come on, little sister. Now who's being boring?

Little Sister: Hey!

Little Fairy: Little sister, we need to find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world, otherwise, we'll freeze.

Little Sister: Oh, all right.

Big Sister: Okay, kindly fox. We'd love you to show us the way.

The Fox: Oh, very good! Right this way.

Bandit hums as they walk across his chest. Big Sister addresses the fox privately as they walk.

Big Sister: I'm usually a real worry wart, but this trek to the Blue Mountains has really shown me how to relax and have fun.

The Fox: Oh, splendid!

Little Sister: I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.

The Fox: That sister of yours is hard work, isn't she?

Big Sister: She sure is.

They arrive at Bandit's open mouth.

Little Sister: It's a cave!

Big Sister: Oh, wow, it stinks!

The Fox: (muffled, as Bandit is trying not to move his mouth) I'm sure it's not that bad.

Big Sister: Oh, Kindly Fox, is there something wrong with your voice?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, no, I just like to talk like this sometimes.

Big Sister: Very strange. Well, we best get going. Are you coming, too, Kindly Fox?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, I actually have to go and buy some more... hand cream.

Big Sister: Okay. Thanks for your help.

The Fox: (muffled) Yep. In you go.

The Fox leaves.

Little Sister: I'm not sure this is a good idea.

Big Sister: Oh, quiet, Little Sister. Now who's a stick in the mud? Last one into the cave's a rotten egg!

Big sister runs towards the cave; Little Sister and Little Fairy chase her.

Big Sister: Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!

She reaches Bandit's mouth, which slams shut on her. Saliva sprays everywhere.

Big Sister: (muffled) Aaah!

Little Fairy and Litte Sister: (gasp)

Little Fairy: Big Sister!

Big Sister: (muffled) Help, Little Sister!

Chilli: (out of character, laughing) He's licking me!

Big Sister: (muffled) Let me out!

Little Sister: It was a trick! What are you gonna do?!

The Fox: (laughs)

Little Sister: You! You are a cheeky fox! That's it. No one traps my big sister. Hyah!

Little Sister picks up The Fox, and with Little Fairy's help, throws him. He lands with his legs lodged in Bandit's nostrils.

Little Sister: Wait for it! Wait for it!

Bandit: Bleahh!

Bandit, unable to breathe, spits out Big Sister, and sends The Fox flying into the sun.

All: Yeah!

The sisters and fairy land on the picnic blanket. Big Sister is covered in spit. Her eye falls off, and she puts it back on.

Big Sister: Ew. I'm all slimy!

Little Sister: Big sister! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

They embrace, wetly.

Little Sister: I promise I'll never say you're boring ever again.

Big Sister: Oh, I was so busy trying to be fun, I forgot the most important thing big sisters are meant to do.

Little Sister: What's that?

Big Sister: Look after their little sisters.

Little Fairy: Look!

Little Fairy points to Bandit's ears.

Little Sister: The softest, warmest beds in the whole world!

Big Sister: Yeah!

Little Fairy: We found them! Hooray!

Big Sister: Oh, it's so soft. And look, there's enough wax in here to make a hundred candles!

Bandit pokes Big Sister with the tip of his ear.

Big Sister: Ohh!

Bluey, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit all laugh.

The puppets are shown sleeping under Bandit's ear.

Chilli: [voiceover] And they all slept happily ever after.

Bluey: "Bob, this is Mixed-up Murphy, he's really funny."

Bingo: "Yea. Really funny."

Chilli: "Oh, Bingo.."

Now outside, a saddened Bingo sits under the tree holding Bob Bilby. Chilli, Bandit and Bluey enter, with Chilli coming to sit beside her.

Chilli: "Are you alright, Bingo?"

Bingo: "This is the most boring time Bob's had in the whole book."

Chilli: "No, that's not true, kiddo!"

Bluey looks at the pictures they've taken with Bob.

Bluey: "Yeah, it is!"

Bingo begins to tear up again.

Bingo: "I'm the worst friend Bob's got. He's never going to want to visit again."

Chilli: "Aww..."

Bandit: "Okay, let's sort this out. What's the best move right now?"

The four contemplate on what to do next.

Bluey: "I know!"

My second day on the planet.

Look at all this. It's amazing!

And look at this little blue thing. Ohh.

And a red thing!

Hi. Agh!

(BOTH GIGGLE) It makes noises. Amazing.

Who are you calling 'It'?

We have names.

Oh, I'm sorry. I was born yesterday.

I don't know what a name is.

It's something you call something.

Like my name is Bluey. And mine's Bingo.

Blue-y.

Bin-go.

BOTH: Yes.

Can I have a name?

You've already got one. It's Bandit.

Ban-dit. I like it.

Oh, look at that.

This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

It's just a stool.

Hello, stool.

My name is Bandit.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) Stools can't talk!

Really? Why? They're not alive.

Alive? Yeah.

Alive?

No, that's not alive.

Oh! Uh, is it?

That's called food. You put it in your mouth.

Why would I put it in my... Ohh.

Oh, I feel like a new dog.

I like food. Thanks for the update.

And stools can't talk.

Kids, what have you done to your dad?

He was born yesterday.

He doesn't know anything.

Are you alive? Yoo-hoo!

Hi, I'm your wife.

My wife?

Yes, and if you want me to stay your wife,

you'll learn about dishwashers.

Dishwasher. Wife.

Wow. There's just so much to learn.

Whoa!

This is outside.

You've got some grass and some wood.

A fence. Argh! Look out!

BOTH: What is it?

There's a giant fireball in the big blue thing.

That's the sun. It's meant to be there.

And the big blue thing is the sky.

Oh. Phew.

This is a swing. Push me!

Swing.

No, the other way.

Oh, OK.

Swing.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) No!

This way.

Oh, swing.

This is... Oh! (BOTH GIGGLE)

So, this is our street.

You've got some cars and, ooh, a bird.

Ooh, rubbish.

Ooh! Don't worry about the sun.

It's meant to be there.

Uh, OK.

Ah, come on, Bandit. Huh?

Keep walking. I have a wife.

OK, Bandit, probably don't say things about the sun

to people at bus stops.

Yeah. Why?

It's hard to explain.

OK, I won't. Food!

(SINGS) Yeah, I got my steak and bacon.

Food! Oh, hey Bandit. Oi!

BOTH: Agh! Dad. No.

That's my pie! Get off it!

Drop! Gimme it.

Here! Food!

Oh, you ate all the sauce!

Sorry, Lucky's Dad. He was born yesterday.

Yeah, I'll say.

(GROANS) I can't hold him!

Run, Lucky's Dad. But I'm going that way.

Food! Just go!

Wah!

Oh. Bye, food. Ugh.

You can't just take people's food. Why?

'Cause it doesn't belong to you.

B-long?

Yeah, like everyone's stuff isn't everyone's, you know?

Everyone?

Look, just don't take people's food.

And don't talk about the sun, OK?

You have to just trust us. Why?

Well, because we've been on this planet longer than you.

That's true. I was only born yesterday.

G'day, Bandit.

I have nothing to say about the sun to you.

(BOTH GIGGLE) Er, great.

Wow. Name?

Oh, that's called a... Wait, Bingo.

It just makes trouble when we tell him what things are called.

Why don't we let him enjoy just looking at things today?

Yeah, we can teach him names later.

Name?

It doesn't matter. Just look.

Alive.

Hello, stool.

It's OK, Dad.

You can stop playing Born Yesterday.

Oh, you sure?

Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, real fun. Thanks.

No worries. I enjoyed it.

I feel like a new dog.

Bingo, can you help me unpack the dishwasher?

Sure.

Oh, good on you, kids.

Uh, kids? BOTH: Yeah?

Has your dad stopped playing Born Yesterday?

Yeah.

OK.

Just checking.

[Theme Song]

The epside begins in the backyard of the Heeler's family house. Bandit is hanging a fabric swing on a branch and Bluey is playing with a slap wrap.

Bingo: Make sure it's nice and high off the ground.

Bandit: Yes, boss.

Bluey snaps the wrap on Bandit's tail.

Bluey: Snap!

Bandit: Ow! Bluey! That's not making this any easier.

Judo peeks over the hedge.

Judo: What are you doing, Bluey's Dad?

Bluey: Hey, Judo.

Bandit: Just putting up a swing.

Bluey: Yeah, it's a fabric swing.

Bingo: Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school.

Judo: I know that. Bluey's my friend.

Bandit finishes putting up the swing.

Bandit: All right, have fun, squids. [He walks off the bench and takes the laundry basket.] I've gotta take the washing in.

Bluey excitingly jumps into the swing, giggling in the process.

Bluey: Let's play butterflies!

Bingo & Judo: Yeah!

[TITLE CARD]

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Butterflies.

The scene transitions to Bluey crawling like a caterpillar.

Bluey: Okay, first, the caterpillar crawls along the ground, [She gets in the swing] then it gets in the cocoon. [She then jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly] Then it hatches as a butterfly. But the butterfly catchers have been hiding and catch it.

Bingo: Ooh, can I be the caterpillar first?

Judo: I'm going first.

Bluey: Come on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey & Bingo run to hide behind the shed, while Judo lies down on the ground and begins crawling.

Bingo: Judo is so bossy.

Bluey: Yeah, she is, but she doesn't have anyone else to play with.

Bingo notices a ladybug walking on the wall of the shed.

Bingo: Ooh!

The scene cuts to a more detailed close-up of Bingo.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to blow his nose ♪

Bluey & Bingo stick out their tongues and blow hard making a farting noise. They both then laugh.

Bluey: She's coming out!

Judo jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly.

Bluey: Catch her!

Judo tries to run away, but Bluey & Bingo catch her. Bingo then lies down on the ground.

Bingo: My turn.

Judo: You're too small to be a caterpillar.

Bingo: No, I'm not!

Bluey: Go on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey then runs towards the shed. Judo gives Bingo an angry look before catching up with Bluey. After that, Bingo starts crawling. She then gets in the swing, struggling a bit in the process.

Judo: [Sigh] Little kids take so long to do everything!

Bluey: She's only got little legs.

Bingo finally gets inside the swing.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

The scene changes to Bluey and Judo standing behind the shed.

Bluey: Hurry up, Bingo.

Judo: Hey, Bluey.

Bluey: Yeah?

Judo: Let's run away from Bingo.

Bluey: What? Why?

Judo: She's taking ages!

Bluey: Well, uh... [She looks towards the swing.]

Judo: Come on!

Bluey: Wait for me!

Bingo finishes the song.

Bingo: Okay! I think I'm almost ready to be a butterfly now!

Bingo jumps out of the swing, again, waving her arms.

Bingo: Ooh! Look at me. I'm a butterfly!

Bingo: I'm flapping around. I hope there's no butterfly catchers nearby!

She takes a look behind the shed, only to find out Bluey & Judo are not there.

Bingo: Oh, where are they?

Bingo goes to looks for them both, still waving her arms. She walks by Bandit who is hanging laundry and still has the slap band on his tail. She then sees Bluey and Judo playing Pat-a-cake.

Bingo: Bluey! You were meant to catch me.

Judo: Aaaaah! Quick, Bluey, run away!

Judo then runs away. Meanwhile, Bluey is put in an uncomfortable situation and has to act fast. She turns around to follow Judo, while a look of regret appears on her face.

Bluey: Quick! We can hide in my house!

Bingo tears up and returns to the swing. Meanwhile, Bluey & Judo emerge from a bush.

Judo: I think we lost her.

Bluey: Uh, I might go and see if Bingo's all right.

Judo: She'll be fine. Now, let's play phones. [Judo types something on a imaginary phone.]

Bluey: Phones?

Judo: Ring, ring. Ring, ring!

Bluey: [Looking at her hands confused]I just think that Bingo might like-

Judo: [Interrupting] Ring, ring!!!

Bluey: Aaah! [Picks up the imaginary phone] Hello?

Judo: Hi. It's me, Judo. I've had such a nice day. Let me tell you all about it.

Bluey: Okay...

Judo: [Walking away] First, I bought some lovely new plants...

Bluey: Oh, is that right?

The scene cuts to Bingo sitting in the swing sad, singing the song. Then the scene cuts back to the front of Judo's house. Bluey is sitting on the lawn. She appears bored.

Judo: So, then I went to the bakery to get some cream buns for Casper, but they ran out of cream buns. Could you believe it?

Bluey: [Looking towards her house] Judo, I think I need to find Bingo.

Judo: So then I asked for chocolate éclairs...

Bluey: Judo-

Judo: ...but they were out of them, too! I mean, come on. I just don't know what the world's coming to.

Bluey: Okay, then. I'm going now. Bye. [Hangs up the imaginary phone.]

[Bluey gets up and quickly runs to her house.]

Bluey: Bingo! Bingo, where are you?

Bluey then runs past Bandit, who was still hanging the laundry. Bluey decides to look for her in the laundry basket, throwing out some of the laundry out.

Bandit: Hey!

Bluey then approaches the swing where Bingo sits.

Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean to run away from you. Well... she didn't make me do it. I did it a bit myself. I'll never do it again, Bingo. I promise. Please can we play together?

Upon not getting an answer from bingo, bluey tears up and sits down on the lawn next to the swing.

Bluey: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love her at all ♪

Bingo: ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bluey: [Turning around to Bingo] ♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

Bingo: [Sticking her head out of the swing] ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bingo then offers a hug to Bluey, which she accepts.

Judo: [Off-screen] Ring, ring!

Bluey: Oh, no! It's Judo on the phone! Tell her I'm not here!

Bingo: No! Quick, hide!

Judo walks by Bandit, who was picking up the laundry basket. As she walks by, she makes the "Ring, ring!" sound, which scares Bandit, causing him to drop the basket. Next she walks by the swing.

Judo: Ring, ring! Bluey! Where are you?

The scene changes to Bluey & Bingo hiding inside the swing.

Bingo: Put your phone on silent!

Bluey: Oh, yeah. Good idea. [Puts the phone on silent, vibrating her hand.] Thanks, Bingo.

Judo then suddenly peeks inside the swing, which scares both Bluey and Bingo.

Judo: There you are! You ran away from me.

Bingo: [Sticks her head out of the swing] Well, you ran away from me!

Bluey: [Also sticks her head out of the swing] And you were ignoring me.

Judo: Oh, yeah. I did...

Bluey: [Gets out of the swing] Okay, new rule. From now on, no one runs away from anyone, okay?

Judo: Okay.

Bingo: Okay.

Bluey: Sorry, Judo.

Judo: That's okay. I'm sorry, too, Bingo.

Bingo: That's okay. Just don't do it again.

The three girls then hug each other, giggling.

Bluey: All right, Bingo, you can be the butterfly.

Bingo: Actually, I wanna be the catcher.

Bluey: Me too.

Judo: Me too.

Bluey: Oh, but who will we catch, then?

Bandit: ♪ I'm gonna put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, I'm gonna --♪

His singing gets interrupted because the three girls jumped on him.

Script.jpg
The episode starts at the Gold Coast, where Chris's house is. The shot cuts inside Nana's house, where Bandit and Stripe have dropped off the kids Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, and Socks. Bluey is trying on her nana's glasses, Socks is playing with Nana's tail, and Muffin and Bingo are chasing after each other, orbiting around her. Bluey gives Nana her glasses back and joins the two.

Bandit: "Okay Mum, at least try and limit the amount of ice blocks to a reasonable number."

Nana: "Okay, got it!"

Stripe: "Right, let's go!"

Bandit: "See 'ya, kids! Be good to Nana!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Nana closes the door as the two exit. The pups stare at her.

The Pups: "Ice blocks!"

Nana: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts outside the apartment, with the pups enjoying their ice blocks and Muffin holding Socks so she can eat hers.

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, sweetie?"

Bluey: "Why do we get lots of ice blocks at your house, but hardly any when we're at our house?"

Nana: "Oh, well, that's a good question!"

Bingo: "Finished! Can we play charades now?"

Bluey & Muffin: "Yeah!"

Socks: "Woof!"

EPISODE TITLE: Charades

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Charades!"

The shot cuts to Nana's apartment, where the pups and Nana sit on the couch. Nana is sorting through the charade cards.

Muffin: "What's charades?"

Bluey: "It's easy, Muffin! First, you pick a card..."

Bingo: "But don't let anyone see it, okay?"

Muffin: "Okay!"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Bluey: "Then, you look at the picture on it!"

The card shows a picture of a duck.

Bluey: "Okay, got it."

Muffin: "What's on the card?"

Bingo: "No, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I need to see it!"

Muffin gets up and tries to pull the card box out of Nana's hands. Bluey and Bingo panic while Socks barks playfully.

Nana: "Oh- uh, no sweetie! We don't look at it! Bluey's going to act it out!"

Bingo: "And then we guess what it is!"

Muffin: "Ohhh!"

Bluey runs in front of the table.

Bluey: "Okay, ready?"

Bingo, Nana and Muffin: "Ready!"

Bluey proceeds to act out being a duck, walking in circles.

Muffin: "Uhhh, eagle!"

Nana: "Ohhh, it's a...bush turkey!"

Bingo: "Ibis!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bluey: "Nope!"

Nana: "Brolga!"

Bingo: "Chicken!"

Nana: "What about you, Socks?"

Socks whines, unable to guess.

Bingo: "Duck!"

The Pups: + Nana: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Good one, Bingo!"

Bingo: "Ooh, my turn!"

Muffin: "I want a turn!"

Bingo and Muffin fight over the card box. Nana stops Muffin as they try to pull it away from each other.

Nana: "Maybe just watch one more, sweetie!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Nana: "Go on, Bingo, pick a card!"

Bingo picks a ballerina card and squeals as she runs up. The shot shows us what the card is, and she sets it down after memorizing it.

Bingo: "Ooh, this is a good one! You ready?"

The Pups + Nana: "Ready!"

Bingo proceeds to act out being a ballerina.

Nana: "Uhhh...circle!"

Bluey: "Donut!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Nana: "The sun!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bingo: "Uh-uh!"

Muffin: "Chicken!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Bluey: "A dancer!"

Bingo: "Close!"

Nana: "Ooh, what do you think, Socks?"

Socks whines, again not being able to guess.

Muffin: "CHICKEN!"

Bluey: "I know! Ballerina!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

Nana: "Hooray!"

Muffin: "Good one, Bluey!"

Socks whines, saddened by being unable to play properly.

Nana: "Oh, never mind, Socks!"

Muffin: "It's my turn!"

Nana: "Okay, Muffin, your turn! Are you sure you know how to do it?"

Muffin runs up to the front, and Bingo goes to sit down.

Nana: "Pick a card! Okay now, take a look!"

Muffin looks down at her card. She gets a frog card.

Nana: "Now act it out!"

Muffin: "I don't want a frog card. I want the ballerina card!"

Nana: "Oh. Uhh...well..."

Bluey: "Muffin, you have to do the one on the card!"

Muffin: "BUT I WANT TO DO THE BALLERINA!"

Nana: "O-oh, okay! Bluey, why don't you look through the box for the ballerina card?"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey looks through the card box.

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Bluey: "...Hang on. Won't we know that Muffin is a ballerina?"

Nana: "Oh, y-yeah, but we'll play along for the littlies, okay?"

Bluey: "Oh, okay nana!"

Nana: "Almost there, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Bluey: "I can't find it!"

Muffin: "Keep looking!"

Bluey pulls a car card out.

Bluey: "What about a car?"

Bingo: "Ooh! Would you like to be a car, Muffin? You can do this!"

Bingo rolls on her back, attempting to emulate a car.

Muffin: "That's a squirrel!"

Nana: "Give me those cards, Bluey!"

Bluey: "That's not a car!"

Bingo: "Yeah it is!"

Bluey: "A car's like this!"

Bluey mimics movement of a steering wheel.

Bingo: "That's a steering wheel!"

Nana: "It must be in here somewhere..."

Muffin: "I don't want to be a car! I want to be a--"

Nana: "Ballerina!"

The Pups:' "Hooray!"

Nana: "There you go, Muffin!"

She gives Muffin the ballerina card.

Muffin: "Thanks, nana!"

Nana: "Okay, off 'ya go!"

Muffin stares at the card, an angry expression still plastered on her face.

Muffin: "I NEED A TUTU!"

The Pups groan in annoyance, and Nana thinking of a quick solution.

Nana: "O-oh, um...Bluey! Go and check Nana's dress-up box for a tutu!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Bingo run off to Nana's room.

Nana: "Quickly! She's going to blow her top!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo in Nana's dress-up room. They look around in the box on the ground.

Bluey: "Ooh. Confetti."

She rummages through the stuff.

Bluey: "Pirate...princess...-"

Bingo: "Tutu!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently, and Nana is petting Socks. Bluey and Bingo run in.

Bluey: "Here's the tutu, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Nana: "Oh, good one, girls!"

Bluey: "Put your legs through, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I'm trying!"

Bingo: "That's your arm!"

Bluey and Bingo help Muffin into her tutu.

Nana: "Push...Yeah, that's it!"

After some struggling they manage to get Muffin's tutu on.

Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Okay...off 'ya go!"

Muffin stands still for a brief moment, ready to act out a ballerina...

Muffin: "I need ballerina music!"

The Pups and Nana groan in annoyance.

Bluey & Bingo: "Muffin!"

Nana: "How about I sing you some?"

She starts singing, only for Muffin to get angered.

Muffin: "NO! IT NEEDS TO BE PROPER BALLERINA MUSIC!"

Bluey: "You don't need music, Muffin! You just need--"

Muffin: "I WANT MUSIC!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Nana: "O-oh, um...Oooh, I know! Bluey, Bingo, come with me!"

The shot cuts to Nana's bedroom, where she grabs a music box on the table.

Nana: "Did you know that I was given this music box by my nana?"

Bluey: "You mean you had a nana?"

Nana: "I did! A long time ago."

Bingo: "Hang on. We all know Muffin is going to be a ballerina."

Nana: "Well yes, I guess we do."

Bingo: "But that's not the proper rules!"

Nana: "You're right, Bingo. But that's what Muffin wants."

Bingo: "I don't understand!"

Nana: "Well, you know what? At Nana's house, I guess there's only one rule."

Bluey & Bingo: "What's that?"

Nana: "Everyone gets what they want!"

Bluey & Bingo: "Oh yeah!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently and Socks staring nervously at her. Bluey, Bingo and Nana enter!

Bluey: "We got the music!"

Nana: "Okay. You ready, Muffin?"

Muffin: "Ready!"

Nana: "You ready, Socks?"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Nana: "You ready, girls?"

Bluey & Bingo: "Ready, Nana!"

Nana: "Okay, let's go!"

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, Bluey?"

Bluey: "Was your nana a nice nana?"

Nana looks down at the music box, a sincere smile on her face.

Nana: "She was about the nicest nana you would ever wanna meet, Bluey."

Nana opens the music box, and begins winding it to create sound. With the music going and the room falling silent, Muffin begins dancing.

Bingo: "Hey Nana? When she's finished, should we pretend that we didn't know what she was?"

Nana: "Good idea, Bingo!"

Bluey: "Cause we have to take care of the littlies!"

Nana: "That's right!"

Muffin: "Shush!"

Nana smiles and continues playing the music box. Soon, the music comes to a close.

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Muffin!"

They throw confetti and Muffin smiles.

Muffin: "Can you guess what I was?"

Bluey, Bingo and Nana:' "Uhh...any idea? What was Muffin...?"

Socks: "Ballerina!"

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Socks!"

The episode pans out, showing the outside sunset as the pups laugh and Socks barking.

Lila: My name is Lila and this is my story (View outside of kindy) This is me on my first day at kindy. I was really shy. Mum says, that's OK, but that meant sometimes I wasn't really good at making friends. I just didn't know how to do it. But then one day that all changed. (The Heeler house) And it started with pet feet.

Bluey: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bingo: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bluey: Oh, you're extra stinky this morning.

This startles Bandit awake.

Bingo: Look at those big muscles! [while she is patting his muscles]

Bandit: [Lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast] Sorry Bingo. You slipped.

Chilli: [Waves goodbye to Bluey & Bingo] I'll see you in the morning, kids.

Bluey: [Runs to Chilli] I don't want you to go.

Chilli: [Rubs Bluey's Cheek] I know sweetie, but Mummy has to go to a baby shower tonight, okay?

[Bandit lets of of Bingo and grabs her fast again. Chilli gets in the car.]

Bandit: Oh! Again!

Bluey: Will I already be asleep when you get back?

Chilli: Yes, but I'll still come in and give you a kiss good night.

Bluey: But I won't feel it!

Chilli: Yes, you will.

Bingo: Who'll put us to bed?

Chilli: Your dad! It's a Daddy putdown.

Bingo: Hooray!

[Bluey lets out a sad yelp.]

Bandit: Don't worry, Bluey. I'm all over it.

He lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast yet again, this time Bingo almost hitting the ground.

Bandit: Whoa! That was a close one. No more of that game.

[Title card]

Bluey (voiceover): This episode of Bluey is called Daddy Putdown.

[The scene changes to the front of the house. Chilli honks the horn and drives off.]

Bandit & Bingo: Bye!

Bandit: Okay, kids, what should we do?

[Bluey takes out Bandit's phone.]

Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.

[Bandit takes the phone away.]

Bandit: We're not doing that.

Bluey: But I miss her!

Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?

Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to the dining room of the Heeler's house.]

Bandit: Right! I'm your Magnificent Leader, and you have to follow me. You kids got that?

Bluey & Bingo: Yes, Leader! [Both giggle]

Bandit: Now off to a better tomorrow!

[Bandit turns around and starts walking in a march-like fashion, with Bluey & Bingo following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪

♪ Something, something, united, we are strong ♪

[Both girls turn around and run into the living room and sit down on the couch. Bandit then walks in.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow-- ♪ Oh, hello, there! I- What?!

[Bluey & Bingo giggle]

Bandit: You were supposed to be following me!

[Bluey & Bingo laugh]

Bandit: Get back in line! [Both girls get off the couch and stand behind Bandit] Sitting around will not be tolerated!

[He starts walking in the march-like fashion with both girls following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪ Hmm. I'd best check on these followers to make sure they are indeed following me.

[He turns around, and Bluey & Bingo quickly get behind him.]

Bandit: Hey! What?

[He turns around multiple times, with both of the girls hiding behind him.]

Bandit: Hmph! Where are they?! Grrr! They've gone again!

[Bandit then looks for them in the house, but both girls still hide behind his back when he turns around. He then walks out of the house into the backyard.]

Bandit: There's that giggling again!

Bluey & Bingo: [whispering] One, two, three...

[They proceed to scare Bandit.]

Bandit: You little traitors!

[Bandit then starts chasing the girls. They run around in circles, before being caught by Bandit and falling down on the ground. Bluey & Bingo then giggle.]

Bingo: [Sits on Bandit's belly] Again!

Bandit: Oh, no, mate. The Magnificent Leader needs a break.

Bluey: I miss Mum! [She sits down on the lawn.]

Bandit: Maybe that game wasn't swingy enough. [Points to the swing.]

Bingo: [Gasps and gets off Bandit and runs up to the swing.] I know! Come Here and Go Away!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to Bandit pushing the swing with both girls sitting on it.]

Bandit: Okay, kids, come here.

[Bluey & Bingo swing to Bandit.]

Bandit: Now, the thing is-- [They swing away.] What?

[Both girls giggle.]

Bandit: Come here! [They swing back to Bandit.]

Bandit: Okay. So, as I was saying-- [They swing away again] What?!

[Both Girls giggle again]

Bandit: I said, come here! [They swing back to Bandit once again.]

Bandit: What? Aah! [They swing away yet again.]

Bluey: Now play Go Away!

Bandit: Okay. Go away! [He pushes the swing away.]

[Bluey & Bingo swing back to Bandit.]

Bluey: Hi!

Bandit: Huh? I said, go away! [He pushes the swing away as both girls start laughing.]

[They swing back to Bandit again.]

This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.

Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.

Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.

Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.

Bingo: Oops.

Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.

Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?

Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?

Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.

Bandit: SCAB!

Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.

Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?

Bandit: Ee!

Bluey: Dad ate it.

Bandit swallows guiltily.

Bingo: (betrayed) What?!

Crossing the Street/First Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Crossing.png
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.

Bingo: I was saving that chippy.

Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.

Bingo: I was still very hungry.

Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.

Bluey: Ah! I know.

Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.

Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!

Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode.

Bingo and Bluey giggle.

TITLE CARD - Dance Mode

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.

Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.

Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!

Bingo: Me too!

Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay.

The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.

Chilli: Green dog. Come on.

The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.

Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Bingo: Um, yes, okay.

Bluey: I'll do it.

Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.

Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! [to the drivers] She's not with us!

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it. Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.

Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!

Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.

Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!

Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.

Chilli: Phew.

Bluey: That was so funny.

Chilli is sweating a lot.

Bandit: You still got it, babe.

Chilli: You'll get yours.

Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.

Bluey: Okay.

Post Office/ Second Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Post-Office.png
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.

Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?

Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.

Bluey: Oh, yeah.

Bandit: Aw, what a shame.

Postie: Next, please.

Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.

Postie: How can I help?

Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.

Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.

Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.

Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.

Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.

Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?

Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --

Chilli: Pretty please.

Chilli makes her Please Face.

Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.

Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.

Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.

Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.

Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.

Bandit: Oh no!

Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.

Chilli: Dance mode!

Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.

Postie: Uh, are you okay?

Bandit does some kicks.

Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card

Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?

Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Bandit does The Running Man.

Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.

Bandit does a Cossack dance.

Bandit: I would if I could, mate.

Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.

Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!

Busker busking in the plaza
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.

Chilli: That was glorious.

Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?

Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.

Music starts to play.

Bluey: What's that noise?

Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;

Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!

Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.

Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.

Bandit: Nothing to see up there.

Bluey: Ooh, look!

Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing Dance Mode on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.

Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)

The Heelers approach.

Busker: Shake your tails!

Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!

Bingo: Wow!

Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?

Bingo: Ooh, yeah!

Bluey: Do it, Bingo.

Bingo: Dance mo--

Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.

Bandit: Oh, hang on.

Chilli: Yeah, hang on.

Bingo: Hey.

Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.

Bingo: Aw, what?

Bluey: No fair!

Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.

Dance-Mode-Bribe.png
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.

Chilli: Bandit, no!

Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!

Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.

Bluey makes her Please Face.

Bluey: Please, Bingo?

Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.

Bandit: Pretty please?

Bingo: Uh. Okay.

Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.

Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!

Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.

Bandit: Phew!

Chilli: This is not good parenting.

Yes/No Button Store
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.

Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.

Bluey: And if you push this one...

Dance-Mode-Shop.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey laughs.

Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?

Bingo: Uh, okay.

Bluey: Hooray!

The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.

Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.

Heeler's Car
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?

Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?

Bingo shakes her head.

Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?

Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."

Dance-Mode-Car-Talk.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?

Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: I thought so.

Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?

Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?

Bandit: This is confusing.

Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.

Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.

Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES

Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.

Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.

Chilli: Me too.

Bandit: Yeah, me too.

Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.

Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?

Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.

Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES

Back at the plaza
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.

Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!

The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.

Bluey: This is gonna be fun!

Bandit: Oh, boy.

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.

Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!

Bingo squeals and moves into position.

Bluey-Bandit-Chilli-Dancemode.png
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.

Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.

Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.

Bingo: Ready?

Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.

Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for my kid.

Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.

Bingo: Dance Moooode!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.

Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!

As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES

Busker: Whoo! Yeah!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.

Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!

Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.

Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!

[End credits]

Busker's song continues through the end credits.

[Bluey takes out Bandit's phone.]

Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.

[Bandit takes the phone away.]

Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?

Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!

[He starts walking in the march-like fashion with both girls following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪ Hmm. I'd best check on these followers to make sure they are indeed following me.

[He turns around, and Bluey & Bingo quickly get behind him.]

Bandit: Hey! What?

[He turns around multiple times, with both of the girls hiding behind him.]

Bandit: Hmph! Where are they?! Grrr! They've gone again!

[Bandit then looks for them in the house, but both girls still hide behind his back when he turns around. He then walks out of the house into the backyard.]

Bandit: There's that giggling again!

Bluey & Bingo: [whispering] One, two, three...

Bandit: Oh, no, mate. The Magnificent Leader needs a break.

Bluey: I miss Mum! [She sits down on the lawn.]

[Theme song]

The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo lying on the floor and drawing in the Heelers' playroom, which is a gigantic mess. There are toys all over the floor, the verandah, and even in the nearby shrubbery. Chilli walks in, holding a potted plant.

Chilli: Alright, kids, time to tidy up.

Bluey and Bingo: Aw, Mum!

Bluey: We don't like tidying.

Chilli: There's no way around it, I'm afraid.

The kids groan. As Chilli walks off, Bluey has an idea.

Bluey: Hey, Bingo. Let's get Daddy Robot to do it!

Bingo: Yeah!

Bluey and Bingo run off to find Daddy Robot.

TITLE CARD - a kids' couch with two socks on it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Daddy Robot!

In the kitchen, Bandit is munching on leftover takeaway in front of the fridge. Bluey and Bingo walk in.

Bluey: Hey, Daddy Robot!

Bandit quickly eats a few more spoons, before putting the container back in the fridge, shutting it, and beginning to act like a robot - which he does for the rest of the episode.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master. (beeps)

Bluey and Bingo giggle.

Bluey: We need you to do something. Come with us to the playroom.

Bluey and Bingo show the direction there.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master.

Suddenly, Bluey realises something.

Bluey: Wait. Actually, carry us to the playroom!

Bandit: Yes, Master.

Bandit mimics machine noises as he picks them both up.

Bingo: We have to robo-boogie there.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master.

Bandit dances towards the playroom as the kids giggle. They reach the playroom, and Bandit stops.

Bluey: Daddy Robot, we order you to tidy up the playroom.

Bandit: (beeps) To serve my masters is the highest honour.

Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit begins cleaning the room.

Bluey: It's working!

Bluey and Bingo sit on a small couch in the room.

Bluey: Ahh!

Bingo: Ahh, so relaxing!

Bluey: Yeah, this is how we should always do it.

Bingo: Yeah.

Bluey: Actually, Daddy Robot, we never want to tidy the playroom ever again!

Bingo: Yeah. Ever again!

Bandit: Never again?

Bluey: Never again! Ever. At all. You understand?

Bandit: Yes, Master.

Bandit drops items in his hand, beeps, and shakes.

Bandit: Recalculating objectives.

Bandit walks behind the kids' couch and lifts it, shanking it as he does.

Bluey and Bingo: Aah! What are you doing, Daddy Robo-o-ot?

Bandit: Following Master's orders. (beeps)

Bluey: Aah! Put us down!

Bingo: (giggles) I love Daddy Robot!

Bandit exits the room, carrying the couch. through the hallway.

Bluey: Where are you taking us?!

Bandit: (beeps) To the wheelie bin.

Bluey: What?! Why?!

Bandit: You two are the reason playroom is always untidy. If I throw you in wheely bin, playroom will always be tidy. And then you will never have to tidy playroom ever again.

Bluey and Bingo: What?!

Bandit: It's a solid plan, Master.

Bluey and Bingo scream in horror as they're carried to the living room, where Chilli is spraying her plant.

Bluey: Mum! Daddy Robot is going to throw us in the wheelie bin!

Chilli: Oh no!

Bluey: Quick, Mum, we need the sprayer!

Chilli: Catch!

Chilli throws the sprayer, which Bluey catches and uses to spray Bandit, making him malfunction and act in strange ways.

Bandit: (various beeps) Syntax error. (buzzes) Please press "play" on tape. (more beeps)

Chilli: He's malfunctioning!

Bandit beeps, then begins to beatbox and dance.

Chilli: Why was Daddy Robot throwing you in the wheely bin?!

Bluey: Oh, um... well...

Bandit: Must tidy up. (beeps and boops) Come here, vacuum cleaner.

Bandit picks up Bluey and uses her as a vacuum cleaner.

Bluey: Aaah! I'm not a vacuum cleaner!

Bingo: Yeah, Daddy Robot! She's not a vacuum cleaner!

Bandit holds Bluey upside-down.

Bandit: Oh yes. (beeps) My mistake. This is not a vacuum cleaner.

Bluey: I told you!

Bandit: It's a banjo.

Bluey: What?!

Bandit begins to play Bluey like a banjo, vocalising banjo sounds as Bluey laughs from being tickled.

Bingo: Hey, that's my sister! Not a banjo!

Bandit puts Bluey down and points to Bingo.

Bandit: (beeps) What are you doing out of the laundry basket?

Bingo: Laundry basket?!

Bandit: Yes. You are laundry. I folded you this morning. Come here.

Bingo screams as she tries to run away. Bandit picks her up as she giggles and brings her to the laundry room. He places her in the basket and folds her limbs.

Bandit: Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold!

Bingo: (giggles) I'm not laundry!

Bluey runs in.

Bluey: She's not laundry!

Bandit turns to Bluey.

Bandit: Oh no. A guinea pig has escaped.

Bluey: What?!

Back in the living room, Chilli is spraying another plant when Bluey runs in, screaming in terror.

Bluey: Mum, Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig! What should I do?!

Bandit enters, squat dancing after Bluey.

Bandit: Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Come back here, guinea pig.

Chilli: You have to push his nose to turn him off!

Bingo runs in with a laundry basket and hides under it.

Bingo: But how?!

Bluey: I know, I've got an idea!

Bandit enters the sunroom, dancing with style. Bluey follows.

Bluey: Look, Daddy Robot!

Bandit buzzes and Chilli enters the room, acting as "Mummy Robot".

Bluey: It's a Mummy Robot!

Chilli: (beeps) Hello.

Bandit: (beeps) Cheese and crackers, you're the most beautiful robot I've ever seen!

Chilli: (beeps) You are too kind.

Bandit: My name is Daddy Rob-

Bandit suddenly breaks into an Irish stepdance, complete with music. Then he and the music suddenly stop. Crickets.

Chilli: That was a little odd.

Meanwhile, Bluey and Bingo get prepared on a couch behind their parents.

Bandit: Please pretend I didn't just do that.

Chilli: It is hard to unsee something like that.

Bandit: Even so...

Suddenly, Bluey and Bingo jump on Bandit and pin him to the ground.

Bandit: Off me, furry creatures!

Chilli stops acting like Mummy Robot.

Chilli: Alright now, turn him off!

Bluey: Touch his nose, touch his nose!

Bluey manages touch Bandit's nose, making him freeze and power down.

Bandit: Powering down...

Chilli gasps and hurries to Bandit's side.

Bandit: Cursed... to depart... having only just... known... your beauty...

Chilli: Aw...

Bandit makes one last whirr before finally shutting down. The kids look at him sadly.

Bingo: Poor Daddy Robot.

A brief silence. Suddenly, Bandit lets loose a huge fart, much to Chilli's disgust and the kids' amusement. Cut to inside the playroom, where Chilli is repairing Bandit in a makeshift workshop lit with a table lamp.

Chilli: Screwdriver.

Bingo hands her a crayon.

Bingo: Screwdriver. Please fix him.

Chilli uses the "screwdriver" on Daddy Robot, tickling him as she does.

Chilli: I'll try my best. These circuits are badly damaged.

Bingo: Aww...

Chilli: It's strange, though. Daddy Robots don't usually go crazy like that.

Bluey: Well, actually, it's our fault.

Bingo: We ordered Daddy Robot to tidy the playroom for us.

Chilli: And that's when he tried to throw you in the wheelie bin?

Bingo: Yeah.

Chilli: Oh. I see. Okay. I'll tell you the secret. Daddy Robots will find the easiest way to do a job.

Bluey and Bingo: Oh.

Chilli: Just... like... kids!

Chilli tickles Bingo. Cut to black, where Bingo can be heard, echoing.

Bingo: I hope he's ok.

The black turns out to be the first-person view from Bandit, who powers up and opens his eyes to see Bluey and Bingo.

Bluey: Hello, Daddy Robot!

Bingo: How are you feeling?

Bandit: (beeps) I dreamt... I met... a robot angel. (buzzes) Hello, Master. What are my orders? (beeps)

Bluey: Follow us.

Back with the playroom mess, Bluey guides a beeping Bandit to two small couches.

Bluey: Now sit down.

Bandit sits on one of the couches.

Bandit: Yes, Master?

Bingo: Now lie back.

Bandit lies back in the couch.

Bandit: (buzzes) Are you sure, master?

Bandit gets up.

Bandit: (buzzes) Shouldn't I tidy something up for you?

Bluey pushes Daddy Robot back.

Bluey and Bingo: No.

Bluey: We order you to relax, Daddy Robot.

Bandit sits back down on the couch and happily gets relaxed. Bingo giggles and runs off.

Bandit: I've never relaxed before. Is this right?

Bluey: Usually, you close your eyes.

Bandit closes his eyes. Bluey turns back and beckons.

Bluey: Look who's here!

Bingo returns with Chilli, who is once again acting as Mummy Robot.

Chilli: (beeps) Hello again.

Upon hearing her, Bandit wakes up, surprised. Chilli beeps and does a pose.

Bandit: Cheese and crackers...

Chilli beeps and buzzes as she makes her way to the other couch and sits on it.

Bingo: You robots relax. We're gonna tidy the playroom.

Bluey: Come on, Bingo!

Bluey and Bingo: Bye, robots!

As Bluey and Bingo pick up their toys, Bandit and Chilli watch the sunset.

Bandit: This... feels like... a robo-dream.

Chilli: Well, kiss me before you wake up.

Bandit and Chilli share a kiss with the setting sun as a background and soaring electronic music. Cut to Bluey and Bingo watching, the music dropping out.

Bluey and Bingo [like schoolkids]: Oooooh!

[End credits]

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a happy electronic piece.

This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.

Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.

Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.

Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.

Bingo: Oops.

Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.

Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?

Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?

Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.

Bandit: SCAB!

Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.

Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?

Bandit: Ee!

Bluey: Dad ate it.

Bandit swallows guiltily.

Bingo: (betrayed) What?!

Crossing the Street/First Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Crossing.png
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.

Bingo: I was saving that chippy.

Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.

Bingo: I was still very hungry.

Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.

Bluey: Ah! I know.

Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.

Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!

Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode.

Bingo and Bluey giggle.

TITLE CARD - Dance Mode

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.

Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.

Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!

Bingo: Me too!

Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay.

The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.

Chilli: Green dog. Come on.

The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.

Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Bingo: Um, yes, okay.

Bluey: I'll do it.

Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.

Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! [to the drivers] She's not with us!

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it. Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.

Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!

Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.

Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!

Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.

Chilli: Phew.

Bluey: That was so funny.

Chilli is sweating a lot.

Bandit: You still got it, babe.

Chilli: You'll get yours.

Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.

Bluey: Okay.

Post Office/ Second Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Post-Office.png
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.

Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?

Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.

Bluey: Oh, yeah.

Bandit: Aw, what a shame.

Postie: Next, please.

Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.

Postie: How can I help?

Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.

Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.

Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.

Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.

Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.

Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?

Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --

Chilli: Pretty please.

Chilli makes her Please Face.

Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.

Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.

Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.

Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.

Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.

Bandit: Oh no!

Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.

Chilli: Dance mode!

Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.

Postie: Uh, are you okay?

Bandit does some kicks.

Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card

Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?

Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Bandit does The Running Man.

Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.

Bandit does a Cossack dance.

Bandit: I would if I could, mate.

Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.

Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!

Busker busking in the plaza
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.

Chilli: That was glorious.

Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?

Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.

Music starts to play.

Bluey: What's that noise?

Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;

Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!

Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.

Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.

Bandit: Nothing to see up there.

Bluey: Ooh, look!

Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing Dance Mode on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.

Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)

The Heelers approach.

Busker: Shake your tails!

Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!

Bingo: Wow!

Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?

Bingo: Ooh, yeah!

Bluey: Do it, Bingo.

Bingo: Dance mo--

Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.

Bandit: Oh, hang on.

Chilli: Yeah, hang on.

Bingo: Hey.

Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.

Bingo: Aw, what?

Bluey: No fair!

Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.

Dance-Mode-Bribe.png
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.

Chilli: Bandit, no!

Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!

Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.

Bluey makes her Please Face.

Bluey: Please, Bingo?

Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.

Bandit: Pretty please?

Bingo: Uh. Okay.

Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.

Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!

Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.

Bandit: Phew!

Chilli: This is not good parenting.

Yes/No Button Store
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.

Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.

Bluey: And if you push this one...

Dance-Mode-Shop.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey laughs.

Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?

Bingo: Uh, okay.

Bluey: Hooray!

The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.

Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.

Heeler's Car
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?

Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?

Bingo shakes her head.

Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?

Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."

Dance-Mode-Car-Talk.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?

Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: I thought so.

Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?

Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?

Bandit: This is confusing.

Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.

Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.

Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES

Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.

Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.

Chilli: Me too.

Bandit: Yeah, me too.

Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.

Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?

Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.

Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES

Back at the plaza
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.

Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!

The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.

Bluey: This is gonna be fun!

Bandit: Oh, boy.

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.

Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!

Bingo squeals and moves into position.

Bluey-Bandit-Chilli-Dancemode.png
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.

Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.

Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.

Bingo: Ready?

Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.

Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for my kid.

Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.

Bingo: Dance Moooode!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.

Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!

As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES

Busker: Whoo! Yeah!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.

Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!

Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.

Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!

[End credits]

Busker's song continues through the end credits.

The episode starts at the Heeler household, in the late evening.

Bandit: "Big sleep tonight, kids! The easter bunny's coming!"

Chilli: "I wonder how many eggs he'll leave you in your easter pouches!"

Bingo: "How do we know he won't forget us again?"

Bluey: "Yeah, like he did last year!"

Chilli: "Look, we've been through this. He didn't forget you! He was just late. He explained it all in his letter, remember?"

The shot moves to Bandit, who reads a note left on the wall from last Easter.

Bandit: "Dear Bluey and Bingo, so sorry I was late with your easter eggs. I had some family stuff on. I won't go into it. Big love, easter bunny. See? He was just busy!"

The Pups: "Okay."

Chilli: "We promise he won't forget this time."

Bandit and Chilli exit. Before she does however, she knocks over a bottle of confetti.

Chilli: "Oh goodness!"

Bandit: "Eh, we'll clean it up in the morning."

Chilli: "Night kids!"

Chilli and Bandit leave.

Bingo: "Bluey!"

Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo?"

Bingo: "Why did the easter bunny only forget us?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

Bingo: "Do you think he'll remember us this time?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I do! Night, Bingo."

Bluey goes to sleep and Bingo stares up at the ceiling.

EPISODE TITLE: Easter

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Easter."

The shot cuts to Bluey waking up in the morning. She suddenly sits up.

Bluey: "It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!"

Bingo is startled and falls out of bed.

Bingo: "Did he come!?"

Bluey checks her easter pouch on her bed.

Bluey: "I'm not sure. I can't see any eggs!"

Bingo goes to check hers as well.

Bingo: "Mine's empty too! He forgot us again!"

Bluey: "Wait!"

Bingo: "What is it?"

Bingo runs over to Bluey, who pulls out a rainbow box out of her easter pouch, the only item in there.

Bluey: "It's a box!"

Bingo: "Eeee, the egg must be inside!"

Bluey opens the box and turns it over, only to find it empty.

Bluey: "It's empty!"

Bingo: "Awwww...."

Bluey: "Let's check yours again!"

Bluey & Bingo run over to the latter's bed, as Bingo reaches into her easter pouch and pulls out the letter B.

Bingo: "There is something! Oh, it's just a buh. He doesn't care about us!"

Discouraged, Bingo sits down with a saddened expression.

Bluey: "He does, Bingo! I think these are clues to where he's hidden our easter eggs!"

Bluey examines the items and tries to think of what it could mean.

Bluey: "Ooh, I know! Letter, box!

The Pups: "Letterbox!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo, who are speeding down the hallways with the easter pouches strapped to their backs. They run down the stairs and outside to the letterbox.

Bingo: "Are the eggs in there?"

Bluey: "No, just a chatterbox."

Bingo: "Is it from the easter bunny!?"

Bluey: "It is! Look!"

Bingo squeals and Bluey tries solving it.

Bluey: "Easter...egg! Hmmm...what's your favorite color?"

Bingo: "Blue, like you!"

Bluey lifts up the blue colored flap on the chatterbox, and shows a picture of the easter egg and a chef hat.

Bluey: "It's a cook's hat, with an egg!"

Bingo: "What does it mean?"

Bluey: "Well, cooks work in the kitchen...maybe the easter eggs are in the kitchen!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

The two laugh and run back inside the house.

Bingo: "The easter bunny knows my favorite color!"

Bluey: "I told you he cares about you!"

The pups run into the kitchen, where Bandit and Chilli are.

Bandit: "Happy Easter-- hey!"

Chilli: "Hey!"

Bluey and Bingo scramble to find the easter eggs, pushing Bandit and Chilli out of the way.

Bluey: "Sorry mum, we're looking for the easter eggs! They could be anywhere..."

Bingo: "Bluey look, it's an egg!"

Bingo points at the front of the refrigerator, where various fridge magnets and letters are shaped to form an easter egg.

The Pups: "Whoa..."

Bingo opens the fridge, and Bluey squeals excitedly, believing their hunt to be over. However, they find nothing.

Bluey: "Ah, they're not in here."

Bingo: "Awww..."

Bluey: "Wait, look at the normal eggs!"

Bingo: "Oh? The Easter Bunny doesn't bring normal eggs. He brings chocolate eggs!"

Bluey: "I know, but look at the end one!"

The camera zooms in on the "egg" that stands out from the rest, at the end of the carton.

Bingo: "Huh? One egg is a kiwi! Maybe there's chocolate inside!"

The shot cuts to Bandit, as Bluey and Bingo run to him.

Bluey: "Dad, is there chocolate in this?"

Bandit: "Let's see!"

Bluey gives Bandit the kiwi, who promptly cuts in half. However, its only a normal kiwi.

Bandit: "No, no chocolate."

Bingo: "Aww..."

Bluey thinks hard on what it could mean, being a potential clue for the easter eggs' true location.

Bluey: "I think I know where the eggs are!"

The pups run to the living room, where the kiwi rug resides.

Bluey: "The kiwi rug!"

Bingo: "I'll look under it!"

Bluey: "Hmm...I can't see them."

Bingo: "Aww...Maybe the easter bunny just likes other children more than me."

Bluey: "No, Bingo, he likes you! It's just that..-"

Bingo: "Ah, look!"

Bingo points to the kiwi rug, where they spot an arrow.

Bluey: "It's an arrow!"

Bingo: "It's pointing to the backyard!"

Bluey: "Come on!"

The pups run outside into the backyard, where they split up to find it.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo checks the sand castle, and Bluey runs to examine another area.

Bingo: "I don't remember that sand castle."

Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Are the poinsettia flowers normally in a straight line?

Bingo: "Hmm...Usually they're more higgledy piggledy."

Bluey: "I think it's a picture."

Bingo: "A picture of what?"

Bluey: "I don't know! But I know how to find out, come on!"

The pups run up the stairs onto the top of the second floor deck. They go to check the poinsettia petals.

Bluey: "Wow."

Bingo: "It's a castle! Our eggs must be in the castle!"

Bluey: "There's a castle in London! We've gotta get to the airport!"

Bingo: "No, Bluey! I think it's a different castle!"

The shot cuts back to the sand castle in the backyard.

Bingo: "I think it's this one!"

Bluey bashes straight into the castle, destroying it. Afterwards, she begins digging a hole into the sand, squealing in excitement.

Bluey: "I hit something!"

Bingo: "Is it chocolate!?"

Bluey: "It is, it is!"

Bingo squeals. Have they finally found the easter eggs?

Bluey: "Wait...it isn't. It's toilet paper."

Bingo: "Awww!"

Bluey: "Hang on, look! Eggs! It's another clue! Come on!"

Bluey runs off, with Bingo following. She falls into the hole Bluey dug, and giggles. The shot cuts to the bathroom, where they begin looking again.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo: "There's no eggs in here!"

Bluey: "There must be! Toilet paper belongs in the toilet! Unless...Oh, no!"

Bingo: "What?"

Bluey: "They might be in Dad's toilet!"

The pups gasp, with the camera zooming in on their fearful faces. The shot then cuts to Bandit on the toilet. Bluey and Bingo peek in.

Bandit: "Ugh...Bandit!"

Bluey: "Augh, it stinks!"

Bingo: "How are we gonna find the next clue?"

Bluey: "Someone has to go in there!"

Bingo: "But it stinks so much we'll die!"

Bluey: "I know!"

Bingo: "Aww...there will be no Easter."

Bluey: "Yes there will be, Bingo. I'm going in!"

Bluey enters the bathroom, holding her breath.

Bluey: "Ugh, it stinks. I can't...do it..."

She falls to the ground, before she suddenly pops back up.

Bluey: "Wait!"

She looks at the mirror, where a drawing of Bluey and Bingo's bedroom window is present. The shot then cuts back to Bluey exiting the bathroom, coughing and catching a breath of fresh air.

Bingo: "Did you find it?"

Bluey gives Bingo a small note with a drawing of the window.

Bingo: "Oh, I know what this is!"

The shot cuts to the pups running into their bedroom. Bingo runs up to the window and holds the note over it.

Bingo: "It's our window! They must be in here!"

Bluey: "But we've already looked here! I don't understand!"

Bingo: "I do. He forgot us again."

Bingo sits down, discouraged. Bluey accepts defeat and sits down with her.

Bluey: "Maybe you're right, Bingo."

Bingo: "It's my fault, Bluey. I'm just a small, forgettable child."

Bluey: "No you're not, Bingo! You're a great child!"

Bingo: "Really?"

Bluey: "Yes, you're smart! You figured out the castle clue all by yourself!"

Bingo: "Yeah, I did!"

Bluey: "It's me who's forgettable."

Bingo: "You are not! You're brave! You went into Dad's stinky toilet!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, I did!"

Bluey stands back up.

Bluey: "We're not forgettable!"

Bingo: "Yeah, we're rememberable!

The pups hug each other.

Bingo: "Happy easter, Bluey."

Bluey: "Happy easter, Bing-oooh! Look!"

Bluey points to the easter decorations on the carpet. They're formed to resemble footprints.

Bingo: "Footprints! Bunny footprints!"

The Pups: "Easter Bunny footprints!"

The two squeal excitedly, running to follow the path. The path leads them to Bandit's workroom, where a lamp is set up right above the yoga ball. As Bluey moves the ball aside, they have finally found the easter basket, full of chocolates and other goodies.

Bingo: "He remembered us!"

END CREDITS

The episode starts with a distant view of the Heeler car on the highway, before cutting to the front of the car with Chilli driving the kids off to Nanas.

Bingo: "Where are we going?"

Chilli: "We're dropping you kids at Nana's remember?"

Bluey and Bingo: "Hooray! TV!"

Bandit: "No TV."

Bluey: "But why not?"

Bandit: "Cause you've been watching it all morning!"

Bluey: "But what are we meant to do?"

Bandit: "I don't know, use your imagination and draw some pictures."

Bluey: "I don't know what to draw?"

Chilli: "Oh nonsense."

Bluey: "Don't worry Bingo, Nana will let us watch TV!"

Chilli: "I heard that."

Bluey: "Hey hang on, why aren't you coming to Nanas?"

Chilli: "Because you and your dad want to spend some time together!"

Bluey: "What?! Without us?"

Bandit: "Yeah, hard to believe isn't it?"

Bluey: "What are you gonna do?"

Bandit: "Well were gonna lie in comfy hammocks wearing sunglasses!"

From this point, it will switch through drawings and back in the car within this point.

Chilli: "Drinking from coconuts with those little umbrellas."

Bandit: "With no kids allowed."

A sign pops down with both the kids face in drawings with little X signs on them.

Chilli: "Yea, no kids allowed!"

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

TITLE SCREEN: Escape

Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called "Escape"!"

TITLE SCREEN END

Bingo: "This is outrageous!"

Bluey: "Yea we're gonna come and join in! You can't stop us!"

Chilli: "Oh no, here come the kids!"

Bingo and Bluey: "Yaahh!"

Bandit: "Well a huge wall pops up, and its ten hundred meters tall!"

Chilli: "Nice one, Dad."

Bluey: "A wall? Why?"

Bandit: "I told you, no kids allowed!"

Bluey: "Well, we hire an eagle to fly us up over the wall!"

Bingo giggles.

Bandit: "Aww, what?"

Chilli: "Well, on the other side of the wall with a huge prickle bush with big prickles!"

Bandit: "Oh, good thinking!"

Chilli: "And, you can't pay the eagle again because you ran out of money! And anyway, he's on the toilet!"

Bingo: "Well then, I brought a lawnmower with me and I'm gonna mow the prickle bush down! Mooowwww!"

Bandit: "Oh no!"

Bluey: "Good one Bingo!"

Chilli: "Well, we go down this secret tunnel to our underground beds."

Bandit: "Which also has hammocks."

Bluey: "Well we go down the tunnel too!"

Chilli: "You can't, there's a manhole cover, which is locked."

Bluey: "Well I get an axe and chop a hole in it!"

Chilli: "It's made of metal, your axe breaks."

Bluey: "Hmm what chops through metal?"

Bandit: "Uh, diamond?"

Chilli: "Bandit don't help them!"

Bandit: "Sorry!"

Bluey: "Hehe! We use a diamond axe and chop through it!"

Bingo: "Hurray!"

Bandit: "Aww no!"

Chilli: "Quick! Time to bail! We get in a car."

Bandit: "Yea, but a cool car. Let's go let's go let's go!"

Bingo: "Bluey let's get in the dream house car!"

Bluey: "Ohh yeahh."

Bandit: "The what?"

Bluey: "The dreamhouse car. It's like a giant dream house on wheels!"

Bingo: "Yeah and it's got 11 burger shops.. and 20 bedrooms, and 40 toilets.. and a spa on the balcony!"

Bandit: "Who's driving it?"

Bluey: "Butlers."

Bandit: "Butlers?! Oh no, punch it mum!"

Chilli: "Punching it!"

Bluey: "Faster butlers!"

Intense car pursuit.

Bandit: "C'mon their gaining!"

Chilli: "I can't go any faster!"

The pursuit continues.

Bluey: "Hi."

Chilli screams.

Bandit: "Right that's it, we drive into the airport, get in the helicopter and we fly off!"

Chilli: "See ya later!"

Bluey: "Well.. we push a button which makes the wheels on the dream house turn into rockets so we fly into the air!"

Motorcyclist Butlers fall down to the ground screaming

Chilli: "Who made this thing?"

Bluey: "Jerry Lee, he's our science butler."

Jerry Lee presses a button that causes a plunger to shoot out to the current pursuing helicopter to stick to them to catch up.

Chilli: "Aah! Dad, get out of here!"

Bandit: "I'm trying! I just need to learn how to fly this thing."

The girls giggle.

Chilli: "That's it, we're punching out!"

Bluey: "Oh so do we! But.. we have special parachutes that still have the spa attached to them. And Jerry Lee is there fanning us."

The girls laugh.

Chilli: "I'm unsure how Jerry Lee earns his money."

Bandit: "Well we leg it!"

Bingo: "We throw cupcakes at you!"

Chilli: "Oh good! I eat them."

Bandit: "And we're getting away!"

Bluey: "But... you run into a big cliff that is that is a million million miles high!"

Bandit: "We're trapped!"

Bluey and Bingos mini spa parachute lands.

Bluey and Bingo: "Thanks Jerry Lee!"

Bluey: "Aha! You've got nowhere to run now! Hehe.."

Chilli: "Ok, you win. We give up, you caught us."

Bluey: "Uh, no. You have to keep trying to get away."

Bandit: "What?

Chilli: "But you caught us. We'll play with you."

Bingo: "No um, we like it when you run away from us

Bandit: "Aw don't be silly give us a hug."

Bluey and Bingo: "Noooo!"

Bluey: "Run Bingo!"

Bandit: "Quick! They're getting away!"

Bluey: "We run as fast as we can!"

Chilli: "We're chasing you!"

Bingo: "We jump on our scooter that's electricity!"

Chilli: "Well we get on our scooter that's electricity, but we've paid Jerry Lee to pull us on a motorbike too!"

Bluey: "Argh Jerry Lee you work for us!"

Bandit: "Yea but not anymore! We gave him our coconut drinks so he likes us better now!"

Bingo: "We scoot to the place where rockets take off and we jump in one, and take off to space."

Chilli: "Yea but we jump onto the tail."

Bandit knocks on the rocket window.

Bandit: "We just want to loove you!"

The kids giggle.

Bingo: "Well we go up to space!"

Bluey: "Yeah where there is no air!"

Chilli: "Dad quick! Take a big breath!"

Bluey: They can't hold it forever.

The parents inhale and hold their breath, with it switching from drawing and back to the car a few times, and then exhaling, and proceeding to let go and fall back.

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Chilli: "Aww you got away!"

Bluey and Bingo: "Hooray! We win!"

Bingo: "We're gonna live on the moon!"

Chilli: Well done.

Both giggling, when at that point they pull up to Nanas.

Bandit: "We're here!"

Nana: "Hi girls!"

It cuts to Nanas apartment.

Chilli: "Have fun with Nana!"

Bluey and Bingo: "We will!"

Bandit: "Thanks mum."

Nana: "You two make the most of it. It's not easily getting time to yourselves."

Chilli: "It certainly isn't. See ya kids."

Bluey and Bingo: See ya!

The parents leave as Nana closes the door.

Bingo: "Nana can we watch TV?"

Nana: "Well ok. If that's what you want!"

Bingo giggles.

Bluey: "No Bingo let's draw!"

Bingo: "Oh ok."

Nana: "Oh, well ok. I'll get the pens and paper."

It cuts to them drawing with Nana on the couch watching them.

Nana: "Ooh. And what's this one, Bingo?"

Bingo: "It's the dream house car, that's what we chased Mum and Dad in."

Nana: "Oh, the dream house car."

Bingo: "That's the spa, see? It has a little dome in it. Hehehe."

Nana: "Oh it does too."

Bluey: "And this is Jerry Lee."

Nana: "Oh, Jerry Lee parachuting, got it."

Bluey: "He's is one of our butlers."

Bingo: "And this is us on the moon!"

Nana: "Oh goodness you kids got good imaginations."

Bluey and Bingo: "Yes Nana."

Nana: "I don't know where you get your ideas from."

The shot goes up with both Bandit and Chilli on the hammocks with coconut drinks with the little umbrellas with it.

The credits roll, it shows Bingo and Bluey in drawing form, dancing around with the OST playing while the entire drawing chasing scene.

Muffin: Ahh!

Stripe: Ugh! I can handle it.

Trixie: Uhh, are you sure?

Stripe: Yeah, I got it covered. Kids, you better share that thing or I'm switching it off!

Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: What?!

Stripe: Woah! Ok, maybe not off. But…

Trixie: Look, I'll handle it.

Stripe: No, I can handle it! You do your thing.

Trixie: Well, okay... if you're sure.

Stripe: Now you have a good think about it, young lady!

Muffin: No! I don't want to!

Stripe: (Pops head in) I'm sorry girls, but Muffin was hogging, so she can't do your Faceycall thing anymore.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay, Uncle Stripe!

Stripe: She needs to learn that other people have- What the?

Muffin: Yes, I can! Now where do I hide?

Bingo: Under a bed!

Muffin: Okay!

Bluey: Don’t help her, Bingo!

Bingo: Why not?

Bluey: Cause she’s not meant to be running away, she’s meant to be in time out for hogging. Hey, that’s my ukulele!

Muffin: You lended it to me!

Bluey: Yeah, but that was ages ago!

Muffin: I’m still playing with it!

Stripe: (Pops head in on Sock's screen) Muffin, you hang that phone up now, young lady!

Muffin: No!

Stripe: Okay, well, I’m ending the whole FaceyTalk!

Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: No!

Stripe: Okay! Okay! Muffin, this is your last chance; you hang that up and march down here now!

Muffin changes Stripe’s face to a gorilla on the FaceyTalk

Muffin: Gorilla man!

Bluey and Bingo: laugh

Stripe: What? What did you- Get this thing off me! That’s it! Where are you? Oh, okay, you’re under a bed. Can’t see whose. Well, there are only so many beds in this house, kid. I’m coming!

Bingo: Oh, no!

Bluey: He’s gonna find you, Muffin!

Bingo: Just give him back his phone.

Muffin: No! Tell me if he’s out there.

Muffin positions the camera in view of the hallway

Bluey: It’s clear, but, Muffin, I don’t think I should help you.

Muffin: What about now?

Muffin positions the camera to show Stripe looking for her under a couch

Bluey and Bingo: Ahh! Not clear! Not clear!

Stripe: Aha! Got you!

Muffin screams and it irritates Stripe, Bluey, Bingo and Socks while running away.

Bandit: (Walks in) Good gravy! What’s going on?

Bandit: (laughs) Classic Stripe.

Stripe is chasing Muffin down a hallway while she’s screaming

Stripe: Get back here, Muffin!

Bandit: Uh, guys?

Stripe: She escaped from time out!

Trixie: We don’t do time out anymore!

Stripe: What? Since when?

Trixie: I read a blog!

Stripe: You didn’t tell me!

Trixie: Cause you’re never here!

Bandit: Hey, uh, guys?

Trixie: Just let me handle it, Stripe.

Stripe: No, Trix, let me handle it. I get to parent too!

Trixie: Yeah, but…you have to do it right.

Stripe: This is how I do it.

Bandit: Guys? Kids, can you switch this off?

Bluey: Ahh! But we’re doing drawing things!

Bandit: Alright, well, can you mute it?

Bluey: Yeah, we can.

Stripe: I feel like…you hog all the parenting.

Trixie: Oh…

Bandit: Is it this one?

Trixie: I don’t mean to.

Bluey: No, try this one.

Trixie: If you say one thing and I say another…

Bandit: Uh, no, that’s not it.

Trixie: …the kids get confused.

Bingo: Oh! I know!

The FaceyTalk is muted

Bandit: You can turn the sound back on once Stripe and Trix have finished chatting. Okay?

Bluey and Bingo: Yes, dad.

The scene shows Stripe and Trix talking (on mute) and later making up with a handshake and hug eachother.

Bluey: Uh, Muffin.. Better look behind you.

Muffin: Why?!

The scene later shows both Trixie and Stripe chasing after a screaming Muffin

Bingo: Stop running away, Muffin!

Bluey: Stop it!

Stripe: Muffin, I would urgently advise you to stop right now!

Trixie: Listen to your father!

Stripe: Let's split up!

Trixie: Good idea!

Trixie runs off to the sofa, meanwhile Stripe continues chasing Muffin

Bluey: Ah! They're working together!

Stripe: Muffin, get back here now!

Muffin: No!

Muffin: Where are they?

Bingo: Your mum's hiding behind the couch!

Muffin: What couch?

Bingo: The couch!

Muffin: We've got lots of couches!

Bingo: It's that couch right there!

Muffin runs to the couch Trixie is hiding behind

Trixie: Got you! Muffin!

Muffin falls, Stripe trips over Trixie

Muffin: I'M FREE!!

Stripe and Trixie: Muffin!

Muffin, trying to run away again, trips on a bone toy and flings the phone up in the air from the verandah.

Stripe: NO! My phone!

Muffin, Trixie, Stripe, Bluey, and Bingo watch as the phone flies up into the air, then falls into the pool.

Bluey: Oh boy..

Muffin: Sorry, dad.

Stripe: Muffin?

Muffin: Yes?

Stripe and Trixie: TIMEOUT.

Muffin: Okay.

Muffin walks to timeout, the call glitches and ends on Stripe's device, and Socks finishes her drawing.

Socks: Finish!

Bluey: Oh, wow, that's great, Socks!

Socks: Thanks.

Bingo: Can I have a turn now, Bluey?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, sure.

Bingo: Thanks.

Bluey: No problem, because we know what happens when you hog.

Bandit: "That's me when I was 10 years old, on holiday with Uncle Rad and Uncle Stripe."

Cutting back to the present day, oh boy this is gonna get repetitive.

Bluey: "Hang on, where's your helmet?"

Bandit: "This was the 80's, man, there were no helmets! It was a wild place."

Cutting back to flashback

Bandit: "Trampoline with no nets, your mum wrote your name on everything, BMX seats were high, music were on cassettes, and skids were big."

It cuts to Bandit skidding, then Radley.

Flashback Bandit: "Woah, good skid, Rad!"

Stripe tries to skid, but what comes out is a screeching sound.

Flashback Bandit: "You can't skid, Stripe!"

Flashback Stripe: "Yes I can!"

Flashback Bandit: "No you can't! And mum wants you!"

Flashback Stripe: "Huh?"

Flashback Bandit: "Make you look, ya dirty chook! Haha! SUFFER!"

Cutting back to the present day.

Bluey and Bingo gasp.

Bluey: "You’re teasing Stripe!"

Bandit: "Afraid so."

Bingo: "But that's mean!"

Bandit: "I told you, this fairy tale is about a mean brother, me!"

The kids gasp, again.

Bandit: "But don't worry, I was about to learn my lesson."

Cutting back to the flashback, where they paused on before continuing.

Flashback Radley: "Bandit, stop teasing Stripe!"

Flashback Bandit: "Make me! Hey Stripe, your wheels aren't turning!"

Flashback Stripe: Riding the bike "Huh? Aaaahhh!" Falling off his bike offscreen.

Flashback Bandit: "Haha! Make you look you dirty—"

Flashback Bandit & Radley: "Chook!"

Flashback Radley: "Jinx!"

It stops like a VHS tape before cutting back into the present

Bluey: "Huh?"

Bingo: "What's Jinx?"

Bandit: "Okay, in the 80's, if 2 people say the exact same word in the exact same time like:"

Cutting back to the flashback, with a reverse effect to when they both said truck, then a slow-mo with Bandit and Rad saying jinx before cutting back to the present day.

Bandit: "One of you will yell out “jinx”."

Cutting to the flashback again, with Radley saying jinx.

Bandit: "Meaning you had 10 seconds to touch them.

They both drop their bikes and Flashback Bandit starts to chase Flashback Radley.

Intense pursuit chase

Flashback Radley: "1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6!"

Flashback Radley tips over a bucket with a crab in it, which Flashback Bandit avoids a crab that got tipped.

Flashback Radley: "7! 8! 9! 10!"

Bandit, speaking over Flashback Radley counting: "If you didn't touch him in that 10 seconds, they'd say—"

Flashback Radley: "Skint!"

Cutting back to present day

Bandit: "And then, they can never speak again."

The kids gasp.

Bingo: "What? So you can't speak forever and ever?"

Bandit: "Nope, you were cursed."

Bluey: "Wow."

Cutting back to the flashback, with Flashback Bandit and Flashback Stripe playing an arcade game looking to as teamed Street Fighter.

Bandit: "The only thing that could break the curse was if that someone says your name."

Flashback Stripe: "Do you want me to say your name?"

Flashback Bandit nods

Flashback Stripe: "Ok, Band.....diddums! Ha!"

Cutting back to present day.

Bluey: "Can't you just say your own name?"

Bandit: "Nope, not allowed to speak."

Bluey: "What happens if you do speak?"

Bandit: "Oh, well, look, I shouldn't tell you, but" Inaudible whispering

If you actually curious, the loser basically owes the winner a drink, mainly a coke.

Bluey & Bingo: "What?"

Bingo: "That's terrible!"

Bandit: "I told you, the 80's was a wild place."

Cutting back to the flashback, with Nana going to order something while her kids play.

Bandit: "Anyway, being cursed is not a lot of fun when you're on holiday."

Flashback Nana: "Kids, you want your fish battered or crumbed?"

Flashback Radley: "Battered."

Flashback Stripe: "Battered!"

Flashback Nana: "How about you? Come on, speak up!"

Flashback Radley: "He wants crumbed."

Flashback Nana: "Ok."

Flashback Stripe: "Yeah, he loves crumbed. Don’t you, Ban... DISHWASHER! Ha!"

Cutting to a outdoor lunch table in the flashback

Bandit: "Ugh, I hated crumbed."

Cutting to the house thing their renting for holiday in the flashback

Flashback Nana: "WHO ATE ALL THE MINI CEREALS?"

Flashback Radley & Stripe: "He did!" They point at Flashback Bandit

Flashback Nana: "All right you, get over here!" She takes off her thongs on her feet and starts chasing Bandit, while Bandit starts running.

Flashback Radley and Stripe giggle as Flashback Bandit is getting chased.

Cutting back to the present day.

Bluey: "Geez, Nana was a bit mean."

Bandit: "Yeah, it was the 80s. Mums were allowed to be mean."

Cutting to the flashback with Flashback Radley and Stripe just poking around in the estuary while Flashback Bob was harvesting clams there.

Bandit: "Dads weren't help either."

Flashback Stripe: "Let's see who can shout the loudest!"

Flashback Radley: "Ok."

Both of them shout as loud as they can.

Flashback Bob: "Kids, keep it down!"

Bandit walks in and taps Bob.

Flashback Bob: "What do you want, Stripe, dah.. Rad, dah.. Gerald, agh whatever your name is!"

Bandit taps himself, showing that he wants him to say his name.

Flashback Bob: "What are you on about?" Looking at Flashback Stripe & Rad "What's on he about?"

Flashback Stripe: "Rad jinxed him! He can't talk until someone says his name!"

Flashback Bob: "All right, so you want me to say your name so you can talk again. Well, you’re dreamin’, mate! Y'know what I call this? I call this a good start. How do I say jinx so none of you can talk?"

Flashback Radley & Stripe: "Dad.."

Flashback Bob: "Is it like this? (He waves his hands around) OooOooh.."

Cutting to the bay where Flashback Stripe & Radley were throwing rocks? Looks like the sunset there, also Flashback Bandit was sitting there while his mum approached him.

Bandit: "I was never going to talk again. No one was going to say my name."

Flashback Nana: "I'm not going to say your name." Sits down next to Bandit "I think this will do you some good, for all holiday, you've been mean to your little brother."

Exhibit Alpha

Flashback Stripe is trying to Tic Tac on a skateboard, while Flashback Bandit is watching.

Flashback Bandit: "You can't tic tac, Stripe!"

Exhibit Beta

Flashback Bandit and Radley playing on an arcade machine, from the perspective on the arcade game screen, with Flashback Stripe in the middle wanting to play.

Flashback Stripe: "It's my turn now!"

Flashback Bandit: "No it isn't!" Shoving Stripe out of the way, without any arms.

Exhibit Gamma

Flashback Stripe just fell off his bike on the ground currently, while Flashback Bandit skids to him.

Flashback Bandit: "Haha, nice stack!"

Cutting back to the beach.

Flashback Nana: "This is a chance for you to have a good think about it."

Bandit: "Nana was right, not about a perm but about me, I haven't been a really good brother to Stripe. I deserved to be cursed."

Cutting to present day

Bingo: "So, when did the curse get broken?"

Bandit: "The very next morning actually."

Cutting to flashbacks, with Flashback Bandit with a toothbrush and a hat going to the shower block.

Bandit: "I was on my way to the shower block to clean my teeth."

Cut back to present day

Bluey: "All by yourself?!"

Bingo: "It was the 80s!"

Cutting back to flashback, with Bandit walking and noticing Stripe on prickly grass.

Flashback Stripe: "Mum! Ow!"

Bandit: "Stripe was taking a shortcut to the toilets, and got stuck in the prickles!"

Flashback Stripe: "Help!"

Cutting back to present day

Bluey: She gasped "So you can tell him you won't help him, unless he says your name!"

Bingo: "Oh yeah!"

Bandit: "You were right, I could've done that."

Cutting back to flashback, Flashback Stripe looks at Flashback Bandit.

Bluey: "So did you?"

Bandit: "Nah, I just helped him."

Flashback Bandit throws his hat for Flashback Stripe to jump on, then on the sidewalk.

Flashback Stripe: "Thanks, Ban.. dina! Haha!"

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

Cutting back to present day

Bluey: "You helped him and even then he didn't say your name?!"

Bandit: "Heh, that's brothers, kid."

Cutting back to flashback

Bandit: "To tell you the truth, I was proud of him."

Flashback Bandit mouth turns into a grin.

Cutting back to present day

Bingo: "So what broke the curse?"

Bandit: "Well, remember I said that this fairy tale has a princess?"

Cutting back to flashback

Flashback Chilli: "Bandit.. Heeler, is this your hat?"

Flashback Bandit looks behind him, seeing Chilli in what looks to be a She-Ra costume

Bluey: "Is that, mum?"

Cutting back to present day

Bandit: "That's mum."

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

Chilli: "Don't listen to him, it wasn't me." Standing in the doorway.

Bandit: "Don't listen to her, it was!"

Chilli: Approaches the 3. "Well look, it might've been. We used to go on holiday on that Caravan Park."

Bandit: "Case closed."

Chilli: "But, I've got no memory of that happening."

Bandit: "Oh, it's like a dagger in my heart."

Bingo: "How did she know your name?"

Cutting to flashback, with Flashback Bandit's hat with it's name on it.

Bandit: "It was written on my hat."

Bingo: "Wow."

Cutting back to present day

Chilli: "Either way, it's a good story."

Bluey: "But, is it true, or not true? I need to know!"

Bandit: "Well, I guess you have to decide. Do you believe in fairy tales?"

Cutting to the full moon, then to Bandit and Chilli putting the kids to bed, before they both approach and hold both hands together. Then cutting to the flashback, with Flashback Chilli approaching Flashback Bandit with his hat.

Flashback Chilli: "Here you go." She gives the hat to Flashback Bandit

Flashback Bandit: "Thanks."

Flashback Chilli: "See you later." Proceeding to run away back.

Flashback Bandit: "Yea, see you later."

The end credits play out, with Flashback Bandit's hat being thrown in the credits on the left side.

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, and an argument at breakfast.

Bluey: You did!

Bandit: I didn't!

Bluey: You did!

Bandit: I did not!

Bluey: Did!

Chilli walks in

Chilli: (yawns) What's going on?

Bluey: Dad blew off right in my face!

Bandit: Did not!

Chilli: Ugh. Bandit, that's a new low!

Bandit: I didn't do it! Why doesn't anyone believe me?

Bingo: 'Cause you're the king of fluffies!

Chilli: I know how to settle this.

Chilli picks up a wooden spoon

Bingo: Yeah! Whack him!

Chilli: What? No.

Chilli taps table with said spoon, much like a gavel.

Chilli: Family meeting.

Bluey and Bingo: Oh!

TITLE CARD: "Family Meeting"

Chilli: This episode of Bluey is called "Family Meeting"

END TITLE CARD

Bluey: Time to pay Fluffy King!

Chilli catches up with the rest, with curlers on, looking almost like a judge's wig.

Chilli: Sorry, just had to put my curlers in.

Chilli taps spoon on table

Chilli: Alright, three rules: one person talks at a time, everyone says, "fluffy" when talking about Dad's... fluffy,

Bandit: Alleged fluffy.

Chilli: …and most importantly everyone tells the truth.

Bluey raises hand

Chilli: (points at Bluey) Yes, you.

Bluey: Do we say that Dad "fluffied" or Dad "fluffed"?

Bandit: Allegedly.

Chilli: Either.

Bluey: What about "he was baking brownies"?

Bluey and Bingo laugh

Bandit: Allegedly!

Chilli taps table

Chilli: Enough.

Bingo: What does "allegebly" mean?

Chilli: It means you both get to tell your side of the story and then I decide who's telling the truth, okay?

Bandit: Yes, Your Honour.

Chilli:(interested) Ooh, I like that. Fourth rule, everyone calls me your honour. Okay, Bluey, you first.

Bluey: Yes, Your Honour.

Scene cuts to a reconstruction on the table, starting with a toy bed and bedside.

Bluey: It all happened this morning. (Places a small dog toy on the bed) Mum, this you asleep, this is me (places a smaller dog toy beside the bed).

Chilli: And where was Dad?

Bingo searches through the toy box for a prop, and pulls out a toy skunk. The girls laugh as Bluey gleefully puts it on the bed next to "Mum".

Bluey: Here!

Bandit: (offended) Hey, your honor!

Chilli: I'll allow it.

Bluey: So I was just here, um, doing something, and Dad got out of bed (picks up "Dad"), turned (turns "him" around) and fluffied right in my face! (raspberries to mimic said fluffy, then gags and coughs)

Chilli: Well, I heard enough.

Bandit: (To Chilli) Hey, hang on!

Chilli: Oh yeah. Your side. Make it quick.

Bandit: (To Bingo) Here, give me.

Bingo gives Bandit the box of toys

Bandit: Check it. (Replaces Bluey's prop for Chilli with a prettier one) Mum was here sleeping, looking gorgeous as usual.

Chilli: Oh, well... (giggles)

Bingo and Bluey look annoyed

Bingo: Hey!

Bluey: You're trying to make Mum like you more!

Bandit: I got up, went downstairs, and got embroiled in this mess.

Bluey: Hey!

Bandit: What!

Bluey: You missed the bit where you fluffied!

Bingo: "Allegbly".

Bandit: It just doesn't sound like the sort of thing I'd do.

The rest of the family react in surprise

All but Bandit: Oh-oh-oh, yes it does!

Bandit: What!?

Flashback; the family are in an elevator. Bluey is resting next to Chilli and Bingo looks bored. Bandit, however, has a trick for her

Bandit: Hey Bingo, pull my finger. (shows finger to Bingo)

Bingo reacts to it as Mum and Bluey become startled hearing that

Bingo: Okay! (proceeds to pull said finger as Bandit prepares for the punchline)

Chilli and Bluey: (hopelessly) Bingo, NO!!

End flashback

Bandit: Well, fair enough. But on the morning of this morning, I did not bake a brownie!

Bluey: Ooh, I've got a idea.

Cuts back to table. Bluey pushes a can of beans and toast on a plate on a sign showing that it's exhibit "a".

Bluey: Is this what you had for breakfast yesterday? Baked beans on wheat toast?

Bandit: Yep.

Bluey: (walks to the next exhibit, a jar of sauerkraut) Bingo, what's the fluffy level on this?

Bingo: (doots as she rises the "fluffy meter"). High.

Bluey: Thank you. And then what did you have for lunch, Mr. Heeler?

Bandit: Ah, just some, um... (discretely) Sauerkraut?

Bluey: Excuse me?

Bandit: (clearly) Sauerkraut.

Bluey: Bingo, fluffy level?

Bingo: (doots and rises the "fluffy meter" higher)

Bluey: Now we had dinner at Indy's house, didn't we?

Bandit: Yep.

Bluey: Can you tell us what you ate?

Bandit: Uh, I'm not sure I ate much.

Chilli: Mr. Heeler!

Bandit: (defeated) Okay, I had a vegan nut roast.

Bingo: Poor dear! (rises meter again)

Bluey: Anything else?

Bandit: Uh, nothing comes to mind.

Bluey: Really? Nothing from the petrol station on the way home that might have gone on this tray? (lifts cloth over exhibit "c", revealing a small empty pie tin)

Bingo and Chilli gasp

Bandit: Oh, well, maybe I had a pie!

Chilli: (disappointed) Oh, Bandit!

Bandit: Well, all I had was nut roast!

Bluey: Bingo, where is the fluffy meter now?

Bingo: (doots as she maximizes the meter) At the top!

Chilli: Sounds like you were ready to blow.

Bandit: My food choices are not on trial!

A closeup on Chilli's hand as she bangs the table again, then cuts to the hearing chair of said table with Bingo on it

Bluey: Bingo, on the morning of this morning, did you see Dad fluffy in my face?

Bingo: Yes, I did.

Bandit: Oh, what?! Bingo, you weren't even there!

Bingo: (giggles) Yes, I was!

Bluey: Thank you, Bingo. You can leave. (whispers to her) Here's a lollipop. (gives Bingo said lollipop Bluey conveniently hid on her back)

Bingo squeals in joy as Bandit discovers this dishonesty

Bandit: Hey, Your Honour!

Chilli: (gets up from her chair) Bingo, are you fibbing to get a lollipop?

Bluey looks sheepish,

Bingo: Yes! (giggles)

…then concerned as Bingo dobbed on her

Chilli: Give me that.

Bingo: Aw... (disappointed, as she passes it to Bluey who then passes it to Chilli)

Chilli: (to Bandit) Forget that bit. (to Bluey) Bluey, that has not helped your case. Remember, the truth will set you free.

Bluey: Okay, Mum.

Bandit: (coughs) I would like to call on... Mum!

Bluey and Bingo gasp

Chilli: Me!?

Cuts to table with the reconstruction bed, with similar setup as previously, then the hearing chair, this time with Chilli.

Bandit: Mrs. Heeler, on the morning of this morning, you didn't hear me fluffy, did you?

Chilli: No.

Bandit: Let's repeat that, you didn't hear me fluffy.

Bluey: 'Cause she was asleep!

Chilli: Yeah. Well, I wasn't asleep. I was dozing. I mean, (to Bandit) I heard you get up and move the bedside table.

Bandit looks surprised

Bandit: What?

Bluey: Oh, really? (to Chilli) Tell me about this bedside table.

Bandit: (hastily) Um, no further questions, You Honour. You can go now, come on. Get.

Cuts back to reconstruction bed

Chilli: Well, Dad charges the tablet on his bedside table at night. And sometimes he knocks it off when he gets up.

Cuts back to hearing chair, as Bandit beside Chilli gets increasingly neurotic

Chilli: And he has to move the table to get it. And it makes this horrible scraping sound like, (tries to vocalize what she heard, then comes realization) oh, no!

Bluey: He didn't move the table! That sound was the fluffy!

Bingo screams as she holds on to her sister.

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit: (nervously) Well, maybe we should here from... Uh, that guy? (points to a direction)

All but Bandit: (looking at the direction) What guy?

Bandit makes a run for it

Bluey and Bingo: Ah! He's running away!

Chilli: Get him, kids!

The kids has their dad in pursuit around the house

Bandit: You'll never catch me alive!

Bandit leaps over a couch then tries to hide behind a plant. After he thinks his kids lost him, he makes another run for it. Fortunately, they manage to get to him in time as he was about to get off from the backyard.

Bandit: Freedom!

Bandit jumps to the backyard, followed by the kids. They are finally able to subdue him as they triumphantly giggle and tickle him.

Bandit:: Ah, get off me! (laughs)

Scene cuts to another closeup of Chilli hitting the table, followed by a shot of Dad tied up with a jump rope held by Bingo, all next to Bluey.

Chilli: (to Bandit) Is there something you'd like to say?

Bandit: Whoever smelt it, dealt it?

Chilli: (knocks the table again as all eyes are closer to Bandit) Mr. Heeler!

Bandit: Okay, okay, I fluffied.

Chilli: In your child's face?

Bandit: Her face is at bum level! It's hard not to!

Chilli: Well, I seem to manage.

Bandit: Oh, like you don't bake the odd brownie.

Chilli: Bandit!

Bingo: That could've been me!

Chilli knocks the table as she states the sentence

Chilli: I sentence you to one hour playing "Horsey Ride", with the defendant (points at Bluey), and her sister (points at Bingo).

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Chilli: See, Bluey? The truth will set you free.

Bandit: Well, let's test that out, shall we? I have one last question.

Chilli: Okay.

Bandit: (walks closer to Bluey, Bingo holds him) The truth's gonna set someone free. Bluey, what were you doing at bum level on the morning of this morning?

Bluey: Oh! Uh...

Chilli: Bluey?

Bluey: Okay. I was playing computer games on the tablet.

Chilli gasps

Bandit: Even though Mum said you weren't allowed to play computer games until the weekend?

Bluey: (sheepishly giggles) Yes.

Chilli: Bluey Christine Heeler! (knocks the table again) I sentence both of you to horsey rides. Saddle up, Bingo!

Bingo: Hooray! ("whips" Bandit with a sticky hand then runs off squealing)

Bandit: Hey!

Bandit, now without Bingo, puts down the jump rope around his waist. Bluey walks up to him.

Bluey: I'm sorry, Dad.

Bandit: I'm sorry, Bluey.

They both hug, which is followed by Chilli getting up after pushing the chair away, with a rather strange sound.

Chilli: (knocks table again, hastily) Okay, family meeting over, everyone out!

Bandit: Huh?

Chilli: Come on, quickly! (starts waving her hands to shoo them away)

Bluey: Why do we have to leave so fast?

Bandit: Yeah, what's the hurry?

Chilli: Come on, out!

Bandit: Hang on...

Chilli and Bluey: What's that smell?

Bandit: Out, out, come on!

Bandit and Bluey: (gasp, then point to Chilli, who looks sheepish) Mum fluffied!

(Chilli stops flapping hands and looks sheepish)

[Theme song]

The episode opens with Bluey, Bandit, Chilli, and Bingo playing Pop Up Croc in their living room. It is Bluey's turn, and she carefully puts a crocodile into one of the bowl's sides as her family anxiously watch on.

Bluey: Ehh... easy...

Bingo: Eh, Bluey, be safe!

Bluey puts her crocodile into the bowl's side, but the person pops up when she does so, shocking the family.

All: Aah!

Everyone except for Bluey laughs.

Bluey: Aww, not fair!

Bandit: How good's Pop Up Croc?

Bluey puts the person back into the bowl.

Bluey: Again!

Chilli: No, upstairs for bedtime.

Bluey immediately runs outside, yelling. Bingo follows her, giggling.

Bandit: Oh, here we go.

Bluey runs outside, still yelling, as fruit bats fly off into the night. Bluey and Bingo stop and watch them.

Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!

TITLE CARD - a rugby ball, a bitten-into papaya slice, and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Fruitbat!

Bandit walks outside to the kids, holding a rugby ball.

Bandit: Alright, say goodnight to the animals. Goodnight, frogs!

Bingo: Night, kangaroos. Night, bilbies.

Bandit: Night, fruit bats!

Bingo: No, not night fruit bats. They don't sleep at night. They're octurnal.

Bandit: Good knowledge, kid.

Bluey: You mean fruit bats don't need to go to bed now?

Bandit: No.

He kicks the ball off into the yard.

Bandit: But you do. Come on, bedtime.

Bandit and Bingo go to walk back inside.

Bluey: I wish I was a fruit bat.

Bandit: Well, fruit bats don't get to do rocket ship.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, rocket ship!

Bluey and Bingo run inside the house. Cut to Bandit holding Bluey and Bingo at the bottom of the stairs as a part of playing rocket ship.

Bingo: Ok, helmets.

Bluey and Bingo mime putting on helmets as Bluey makes a putting-on-helmet sound.

Bluey: Seatbelts!

They mime putting on seatbelts.

Bluey and Bingo: Click!

Bingo: Close the door.

They both mime closing the door.

Bluey: Clunk.

Bingo [overlapping]: Click.

Bluey: Ok, push the button!

They both mime pushing a button on Bandit's chest.

Bluey and Bingo: Boop!

Bandit mimics the noise of a rocket taking off, running up the stairs and taking a giggling Bluey and Bingo with him. Bandit lands outside the bathroom.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Bandit: Ok, shower time.

Bandit lets Bingo down and she runs into the bathroom, but Bluey clings tightly to him.

Bluey: No, more rocket ship! I don't need a shower.

Bandit: Yeah, you do, ya grub.

Bandit sniffs Bluey and is disgusted by the smell.

Bandit: Poahh!

He puts Bluey down.

Bluey: Not fair. I bet fruit bats don't have to have showers.

Bandit: Well, then they wouldn't get to play penguins.

Bluey: Yeah, penguins!

Bluey runs into the bathroom.

(Note: The scene that follows is cut from international versions of the episode due to the penguin game - which involves Bluey sliding on water on the bathroom floor - being considered too dangerous for kids.)

Bluey takes a mug and pours water on the floor. She then slides around on the floor like a penguin while Bingo is showering with an umbrella and wiping her hand on the misted glass.

Bluey: Whee!

Chilli walks in.

Chilli: Teeth time.

Bluey: Mum! Look, I'm a penguin!

Bluey slides around some more.

Bluey: Whee!

Chilli: Oh, whackadoo!

Later, Bingo is on the toilet while reading a book.

Bingo: Even though I don't really need to do a wee, I'm going to do one anyway, otherwise I might wet the bed.

Bandit is just outside the toilet, drying Bluey while she is brushing her teeth.

Bandit: That's very clever, Bingo.

Bingo: It's called a tactical wee.

Bluey: Not fair. I wanna stay up like the fruit bat.

Bandit: Well, when the fruit bats go to the toilet, they do it hanging upside down, so the wee just runs all over them!

Bandit tickles Bluey.

Bandit: Blech!

Bluey: Ugh! I'd love that!

Bandit: I bet you would, you little grub!

Later, in the kids' bedroom, Bluey is jumping on her bed and flapping her arms like a fruit bat. Chilli is brushing Bingo's fur on the other bed.

Bluey: Eee! Eee!

Bluey lands on the floor as Bandit comes in with a book.

Bandit: Come on, that's a daytime game.

Bluey: Aww, I just wanna be a fruit bat.

Bandit: Yeah, yeah, I know. But fruit bats don't get to play the story game, where I tell a story but pretend to fall asleep.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Cut to Bandit in Bluey's bed, reading a story to Bluey and Bingo, who are lying either side of him.

Bandit: So, the little puppy peeked in the window, and on the table was the most beautiful-

Bandit pretends to fall asleep, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle, then shake him awake.

Bluey and Bingo: Wake up!

Bandit: (snorts awake) Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry. I think I must have just dozed off. Now, where was I? Oh yeah... the most beautiful golden egg she'd ever seen. So she climbed inside, but out jumped a huge, hairy-

Bandit pretends to fall asleep again, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle.

Bluey and Bingo: Wake up!

Bandit: (snorts awake) Spider!

Bingo and Bluey giggle more. Later, Bandit and Chilli are saying goodnight to the kids. Chilli kisses Bingo.

Bluey: Aww, I'm not tired.

Chilli: I know. Just try, Ok?

Bluey: It's not fair.

Chilli: Night, Bluey.

Bluey tries going to sleep, but she can't. She groans and wriggles and kicks the bedsheets off her.

Bluey: Ugh! I can't fall asleep! Psst, Bingo, are you awake?

Cut to Bingo, fast asleep and starfishing in her bed, separate from all her sheets and her pillow.

Bluey: Hmmph!

In the living room, Bandit is fast asleep on the floor with the rugby ball. Chilli is putting tape on her hockey stick when she hears the stairs creak. She looks up and sees Bluey on top of the staircase.

Chilli: Bluey!

Bluey walks down to Chilli.

Chilli: What am I gonna do with you, hey?

Bluey: Let me stay up?

Chilli: Ehh...

Bluey sees Bandit, who starts moving around while in his sleep, grapppling with the ball. Bluey giggles.

Bluey: What's Dad doing?

Chilli: Hmm. I'd say he's dreaming about playing touch football with his mates.

Bluey: Really?

Chilli: Yeah. He doesn't get to play that much anymore, so he keeps having dreams about it.

Bluey: Why doesn't he get to play it for real life?

Chilli: Well, he's busy, sweetheart. Busy working and looking after you two.

Bluey: Oh.

Bandit puts the ball down and starts cheering in his sleep.

Bluey: Oh, look! Did he just score a try?

Chilli: I think he did.

Bluey giggles, then realises.

Bluey: Ooh, maybe I can dream about being a fruit bat.

Chilli: Well, you could give it a go.

Bluey runs back up the stairs to her bedroom.

Bluey: Night, Mum!

Chilli: Oh. Ok. Night, honey.

Later, Bluey is back in her bed, still trying to fall asleep.

Bluey: Come on! Come on! (groans) Dream about being a fruit bat!

Bluey opens her eyes to find out she's still awake, and groans in annoyance. In the living room, Chilli is putting a huge crocodile in an even bigger Pop Up Croc bowl as Bluey walks down the stairs - confirming that Bluey is now dreaming.

Bluey: It didn't work.

Chilli: Oh well, you tried.

Bluey: Where'd Dad go?

Chilli: He's outside.

Bluey heads out onto the verandah.

Bluey: Dad!

Bluey looks up at the sky, then starts flapping her arms like wings and flies up to join some fruit bats in the night sky.

Bluey: Dad! Dad!

Bluey flies through the suburb, past Mackenzie's house where he is sleeping in his bed, then lands in a mango tree and hangs upside down on the branches while eating one. She does the same with a papaya tree, a banana tree, and a guava tree. She burps, then hears Bandit's voice.

Bandit [from a distance]: Mine!

Bluey flies over to see Bandit playing touch football with Rocko, Stripe, Pat, Mackenzie's Dad, and another dog - just as Chilli told her earlier. She hangs upside down on some stadium lights and watches Bandit play.

Pat [offscreen]: Bandit!

Bandit: Yes mate, yes mate, yes mate!

Mackenzie's Dad [offscreen]: Kick it!

Pat [offscreen]: Right, run!

Rocko [offscreen]: Whoa!

Bandit scores a try and celebrates.

All: Yeah!

Bluey calls to Bandit from the light.

Bluey: Hey, Dad!

Bandit: Hey, Bluey! You're a fruit bat!

Bluey: Yeah!

Bandit: How is it?

Bluey: It's great! You get to eat a lot of fruit!

Bandit: Ha! I bet! Hey, did you see my try?

Bluey: Yeah, I did!

Bandit: How good was it!

Bluey: So good.

Bandit turns to Pat and Mackenzie's Dad.

Bandit: There's plenty more where that came from!

Mackenzie's Dad elbows Bandit playfully as Pat throws the ball over to Bandit.

Mackenzie's Dad: Ha ha, ya reckon?

Pat [overlapping]: Yeah, sure.

Bandit: Yeah, I do!

Bandit elbows Mackenzie's Dad back. Pat laughs.

Mackenzie's Dad: Oh, righto.

Pat and Mackenzie's Dad walk off.

Bandit: Alright, see ya Bluey.

He runs after his mates.

Bandit: Come on, let's do this!

Bluey: See ya, Dad!

Bluey flies off, upwards and in front of the moon. One of the clouds then transitions back to Bluey's bed, where it is now the next morning. Bluey wakes up.

Bluey: Wow!

In the kitchen, Bandit is doing sit-ups while Chilli and Bingo are having fruit salad. Bluey walks in.

Bluey: Hi!

Chilli: 7 o'clock? That was a big sleep.

Bluey: I had the most amazing dream.

Bandit picks up Bluey and starts bench pressing her.

Bandit: One, two, three...

Bluey: Dad?

Bandit: ...four, five, six... Yes, mate? ...seven...

Bluey: Thanks for looking after us.

Bandit: ...eight, nine, ten!

Bandit puts Bluey down on him and touches her nose.

Bandit: You're welcome.

Bluey giggles.

Chilli: I've got your favourite, Bluey. Fruit salad!

Bluey: Yuck! No more fruit. Just some toast, please.

Chilli and Bingo are surprised with Bluey's response. They look at each other.

Bingo: (hums "I don't know")

[End credits]

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a piano-based tune with vocals. Bluey is dancing.

Bandit: Oh-ho! That was a big one.

Chilli: Charming.

Bluey and Bingo run into the room.

Bluey: Mum, can you and Dad smoochy kiss?

Bandit: Yup.

Bandit turns his head to kiss Chilli, but before he could do that, she blocked him with a book she was reading.

Chilli: Not so fast! Why do you want us to smoochy kiss?

Bingo: Because we like it.

Bluey: Yeah, it's very romance.

Chilli: Where did you learn that word?

Bluey: TV.

Bingo: We know all about romance.

Chilli: Well, maybe you could teach your dad about that.

Nail flies off.

Bandit: Outrageous!

Bluey: Yeah, let's teach Dad!

Bingo: We can set up the restaurant.

Bluey: The Fancy Restaurant!

Bingo: Yeah!

This episode of Bluey is called Fancy Restaurant.

Bandit and Chilli walk in the imaginary Fancy Restaurant.

Bandit: I'll show you a thing or two about romance.

Chilli: Ooh, can't wait.

Bluey: Hello. Welcome to the Fancy Restaurant. Are you husband and wife?

Bandit grabs Chilli by the hand.

Bandit: Yes, we are.

Chilli lets go of Bandit's hand.

Chilli: No, we aren't.

Bandit: Huh?

Chilli: This is our first date. We met five minutes ago.

Bluey: Very good. Do you have a booking?

Bandit: Ah, yes. The name's Romeo McFlourish.

Bluey: Hmm, Romeo.

She slides her finger down the booking list.

Bluey: Nope, never heard of you.

Bandit: Oh. Well, can we have a table anyway?

Bluey: You'll have to make a booking.

Bandit: Well, I'd like to make a booking, please.

Bluey: No, you have to call.

Bandit: Ugh. OK. Boop. Ring-ring.

Bluey: Hello?

Bandit: Hi. I'd like to make a booking, please.

Bluey: Name?

Bandit: Romeo... Oh, uh, what was it?

Chilli: McFlourish.

Bandit: McFlourish. Of course.

Bluey: OK, great. See you soon. Bee-boop. Hi, do you have a booking?

Bandit: Yes, McFlourish.

Bluey: Oh, yes. Right this way, please.

Bandit: Finally.

Chilli: Smooth, Romeo.

Bandit and Chilli are sitting at a table.

Bandit: I have, of course, taken you to the fanciest restaurant in town.

Bingo enters holding a pan with a can of beans on it.

Bingo: Baked beans!

She slams the pan on the table which scares both Bandit & Chilli.

Chilli: Oh, dear.

Bluey: Not yet, Chef Bingo.

Bingo takes the frying pan and starts to leave the room with Bluey following her.

Bingo: Have they smoochy kissed yet?

Bluey: No, not yet.

Bluey turns around and walks back to the table.

Bluey: I'm so sorry. She's new. Now, these are the menus. You also have some forks and spoons.

Bluey hands the menus to Bandit & Chilli.

Bandit: Told you this place was fancy.

Bluey: Now, what would you like to order?

Chilli: Could you tell me what the special is?

Bluey: Mm, I'm not sure. I'll check with the chef.

She turns around.

Bluey: HEY, CHEF!

Bingo: What?

Bluey: What's the special?

Bingo: The WHAT?

Bluey: THE SPECIAL!

Bingo: The WHAT?

Bluey makes a disappointed face and then turns around to Bandit & Chilli.

Bluey: There's no special.

Chilli: I'll just have the baked beans, then.

Bandit & Chilli hand the menus back to Bluey.

Bluey: Very good. I'll be right back. Please enjoy your cutlery.

Bluey walks away.

Bandit: [Standing up] Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.

Bandit runs to the imaginary kitchen.

Bandit: Hey, dodgy brothers. Haven't you got anything other than baked beans?

Bingo: What's wrong with baked beans?

Bandit: Well, they're not very romance.

Bingo: Hmm. Yeah, I guess we could make something else.

Bluey: Something special?

Bingo: Yeah, something special!

Bluey: Ooh, and I'll play some romance music.

Bingo giggles.

Bluey: Leave it to us. Now go and do a smoochy kiss.

Bluey starts pushing Bandit back to the table.

Bandit: Hey!

Bandit: Oh. I'm back.

Bandit sits down.

Chilli: So, has the romance started yet?

Bandit: Very soon, my darling... Uh, what's your name again?

Chilli: Oh! Super smooth.

Bluey starts playing annoying music on a keytar.

Bluey: Ooh, what's this? Some romance music.

Chilli: [Covering her ears] Oh. It's...lovely!

Bandit: [Trying to push away Bluey] So, ah...

Bluey: Hey!

Bandit: Tell me more about...

Bluey: Let go!

Bandit: ..your stuff.

Bandit falls off the chair and Bluey stops playing on the keytar.

Chilli: [Standing up] If you'll excuse me.

Bandit: What? You're leaving me?

Chilli: I'm just going to the bathroom.

Bluey: Oh, yes, it's just in that corner next to the bookshelf.

Chilli: Oh. Fancy.

Chilli walks away.

Bluey: Why haven't you smoochy kissed her yet?

Bandit: Well, how can I when you're making all that racket?

Bluey: You need to be more romance.

Bandit: I'm trying! I think I've just forgotten my moves. I guess it has been a while.

Bluey: Well, toughen up, Romeo. We wanna see a smoochy kiss.

The scene changes to the interior of a fridge.

Bingo: [Opens the fridge] Ooh. This looks special.

The scene changes back to the table.

Chilli: I'm back. [Sits down]

Bluey: Very good, madam.

Bandit: Ah, so, did you have a nice time in the toilet?

Chilli: Excuse me?

Bluey facepalms.

Bingo: Bluey, I need you!

Bluey: Just a moment.

She points her finger at Bandit:

Bluey: Be. Romance.

Bluey runs to the imaginary kitchen. She looks at the jelly with spaghetti and beans on it.

Bluey: Wow. So beautiful.

Bingo: I made a special.

Bluey: You used real food.

Bingo: Is that special?

Bluey: Yeah, that's really special.

Back at the table.

Chilli: There's no romance coming, is there?

Bandit: Ugh. No. I'm sorry. I may have forgotten how to be romance.

Chilli: Well, I have too. It's not easy when you're tired all the time.

Bandit: Yeah, and when you get interrupted every five...

Bluey: [Interrupting] Dinner!

Bluey places a can of beans on the table.

Bluey: Here's your baked beans. And here's your special dinner!

Bluey removes the cloth from the jelly made by Bingo.

Chilli: Wow. That is...special.

Bluey: Our chef made this especially for you.

Chilli: Oh, you shouldn't have.

Bluey: [Gives Chilli a spoon] Here you go, madam.

Chilli: Thank you. [Pretends to eat the jelly] Mm, so good.

Bluey: You can't just eat it pretend.

Bingo: Yeah, you have to eat it for real life.

Chilli: Oh. Um, the thing is...

Bingo: You don't like it?

Chilli: Um, well I do, but...

Bingo: You don't think it's special.

Bluey embraces Bingo while giving Chilli an angry look.

Chilli: Um, uh... It's just... Um...

Bandit: Hang on. I know this isn't very romantic, but can we swap? Yours looks delicious.

Both smile at each other.

Chilli: Oh, OK. I guess we could.

Chilli gives the spoon with the jelly to Bandit. He looks at it for a second.

Bandit: To romance.

He eats the jelly while making a disgusted face.

Bandit: Ohh. Ugh, it's great.

Bluey: You have to finish it.

Bandit: Oh. OK. Bleh! [Coughs] Oh, so good. Oh, man. I can't get enough of this.

The scene changes to the night sky with owls hooting in the background. The scene then changes back the the table with the empty plate.

Bandit puts the spoon on the plate. He then proceeds to cough.

Bluey: Would you like dessert?

Chilli: [Suddenly standing up] Ah, no! I mean, uh, this was such a special evening. I feel like taking a moonlit stroll with my new love.

Bingo: They're holding hands.

Bluey: Oh, yes. The moon is that way.

Chilli: This way, my special man. [She goes out into the backyard with Bandit]

Bluey: Well, they didn't smoochy kiss, but she is rubbing his back.

Bingo: Yeah, that's still romance.

Bluey: Yeah.

Bluey and Bingo walk back into the house. The episode ends with Bandit vomiting being cut off.
