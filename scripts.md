Army
Jack: Mum!

Jack's mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!

Jack's mum: How was your first day at your new school?

Jack: Good.

Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.

Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.

Jack's dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?

Jack: Yes, Dad.

Jack's dad: Did you remember your hat?

Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?

Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!

(goat maahs)

Jack's dad: Jack, your hat?

Jack: I forgot it.

Jack's dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?

Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!

Jack's dad: Jaaaack.

Jack: Sorry, I forgot.

Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?

Jack: I don't know.

Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.

Calypso: Well, hello.

Calypso: You must be my new student.

Jack: I'm Jack.

Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.

Jack: Grr!

Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there. (the red kelpie Calypso is referring to is Rusty)

Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!

Jack's dad: You have fun, mate!

Jack: I will!

Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.

Jack: What are you playing?

Rusty: I'm playing army.

Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.

Jack: Can I be in the army?

Rusty: Well, maybe.

Rusty: Can you do as you're told?

Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...

Rusty: Attention!

Jack: Ah!

Rusty: On the left! Quick march!

Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: On the right!

Rusty: March! Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: Salute!

Rusty: Yeah, you can play.

Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.

Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier.

Rusty: You have to go through basic training.

Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.

Rusty: That's me.

Jack: Oh. Ok.

Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?

Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.

Rusty: You can use my spare.

Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.

Jack: Yes sergeant.

Rusty: Hup!

Jack: Hup!

(both laugh)

Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.

Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.

Rusty: Stop!

(Jack showing hand signals)

Jack: This one means "stop!"

Jack: This means "get down!"

Jack: This is "move over there."

(Jack stops showing hand signals)

Jack: Ha!

Coco: I'll get it! Huh?

Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.

Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.

Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.

Jack: Also, everything had a name.

Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.

Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.

Rusty: That blue gem is called Tango Seven.

Rusty: You got that?

Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.

Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.

Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.

Jack: A dust-off?

Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.

Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.

Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.

Jack: Grunts (while doing push-ups)

Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.

Jack: It's when you're a guard.

Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.

Jack: I loved it.

Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.

Jack: I was really good at sentry.

Rusty: You're really good at sentry.

Jack: Thanks, Sarge.

Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.

Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.

Jack: How do you know so much about the army?

Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.

Jack: Is he on patrol like us?

Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.

Jack: Oh, that's good.

Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.

Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!

Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.

(Rustling in grass)

(Rusty gasps)

(Rustling continues)

Rusty: Contact!

Jack: What do we do?

Rusty: Fall back!

(Both say Arrgh)

(Turkey gobbles)

Rusty: Get down!

(Jack grunts)

Rusty: There's too many of them!

Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!

Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.

Rusty: (speaking into a dotted cylindrical object) Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded!

Rusty: Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?

Jack: It was all down to me.

Jack: I had to remember what that tree was called.

Jack: Tango Five?

Jack: No, Tango Six?

Jack: Tango Seven!

Rusty: (speaking into object once again) We're next to Tango Seven, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven.

Rusty: LZ is no good!

Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.

Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!

Jack: How?

Rusty: Run!

Jack: One thing I can do is run.

Jack: I'm a Jack Russell!

(Jack zooms by Rusty)

Rusty: Whoa!

Rusty: Get to the chopper!

Jack: Ok!

Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.

Jack: We made it!

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

(Both laugh)

Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.

Rusty: Why did you come to this school?

Rusty: Was there something wrong with your old school.

Jack: No.

Jack. There's something wrong with me.

Jack: I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.

Rusty: Oh.

Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.

Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso.

Rusty: You're all safe.

Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.

Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.

Jack: I was in the army.

Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.

Jack: And then it was pick-up time.

Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.

Jack: And now I'm here.

Jack's mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.

Jack: Yeah.

Jack's mum: Good boy, Jack.

Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?

Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?

Jack: Rusty gave it to me.

Rusty: See you, Jack!

Rusty's dad: Hey! Rusty!

Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.

Asparagus
Bingo, Bandit, Bluey, and Chilli are eating dinner in the dining room. Bluey is loudly chewing with her mouth open.

Bluey: (chewing) Agh! Agh! Glargh!

Bluey points at Bingo with her fork.

Bluey: (incomprehensible with her mouth full) Bla-bl-bl-blah, bl-bloo!

Bandit: Bluey, don't talk with your mouth full and sit up straight, don't slouch, it's bad manners.

Bingo: (with mouth full) Is this bad manners? Blaaaaaaaah.

Bingo sticks out her tongue, with a wad of chewed food on it.

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: (giggles)

Bluey: Mum, why do we have to have manners?

Bandit: Because we're not animals.

Chili: I'm happy as long you eat your veggies.

Bandit: Hey, hey, hey! Elbows off the table, thanks Mum.

Chili: (scoffs) Ha!

Bandit: Can you believe that, kids? Ha!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggles)

Chili: (whispering) Psst, Bluey, take this, it's a magic asparagus.

Bluey: What does it do?

Chili: It turns people into any animal you want!

Bluey: For real life?

Chili: For real life.

Chilli hands Bluey the asparagus.

Bluey: Ooooh!

Bandit: Don't play with your food! Blu--

Bluey: (pointing the asparagus like a magic wand) Donkey!

Bandit gets down on his hands and knees.

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw!

Others: (laughter)

Bluey: It worked!

Bandit: Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bingo: Do me! Do me!

Bluey: Okay. Warthog!

Bingo: No, no, I want to be a piglet.

Bluey: Piglet!

Bingo snorts, then jumps down from the chair and begins to run around the room on all fours.

Bingo: (imitating a pig) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Eeee! Eee!

Chilli: Now that's taken care of, I need you to do a little something for me.

Bluey: Chicken!

Chilli stands up so quickly she knocks over her chair, holding her arms like wings.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Ba-kaw!

TITLE CARD: Asparagus

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Asparagus.

END TITLE CARD

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo enter the kitchen together, still doing their animal impressions. Bluey runs in after them.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Bawk! Bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk!

Bingo: (imitating a piglet) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bluey: Elephant!

Bandit stands up, and holds his arm in front of his face like a trunk. Bingo runs through his legs and offscreen.

Bandit: (imitating an elephant) Vrooooo! Vrooooo!

Bluey: I love this!

Bingo runs through the scene, still imitating a piglet.

Bingo: Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bluey: Here, chook, chook, chook!

Chilli: (approaching with a chicken walk) Bawk-bawk-bawk, braawk!

Bluey: Goat!

Chilli gets down on hands and knees. She's drawn with buck teeth and a shorter tail.

Chilli: (imitating a goat) N-e-eh! N-e-eh!

Chilli walks offscreen, and Bingo runs through the scene again

Bluey: Now, be free, my animal friends. No more rules for anyone.

Bingo runs through the scene again, and this time there's a crashing noise from offscreen. The camera pans over to show Bingo digging through a cupboard. Potato chips and a can of beans are spilled on the floor.

Bluey: Aaah! Pig Bingo, you're making a mess!

Bluey grabs Bingo by the waist and drags her out of the cupboard. Bingo struggles as Bluey tries to hold her down.

Bluey: Come here you wriggly little--

Bandit enters from offscreen and picks Bluey up with his "trunk". Bingo immediately dives back into the cupboard.

Bandit: Vroooo!

Bluey: Aaaaaah! Put me down! Aaah! Meerkat!

Bandit stands up on his tiptoes, arms held in front of him.

Bandit: (imitating a meerkat) Um-dum-dum! Hey! Hey!

Bluey: You can't just grab people and swing them around!

Bandit scampers to the fridge on all fours, then stands up to look around.

Bandit: Hey, hey!

Back on all fours, Bandit scampers out of the room.

Bluey: (laughs)

A dog toy squeaks from offscreen. The camera pans, and shows Chilli leaning on the kitchen counter, nibbling on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Polly Puppy! Mouse!

Chilli gets down on all fours and makes herself as small as she can.

Chilli: (imitating a mouse) Squeeeeak!

Bluey: You can't chew people's toys!

Chilli scratches her ear.

Bluey: It's not nice!

Chilli: Squeak! Squeak!

Bingo runs into the scene again, with an open bag of chips in her mouth.

Bingo: Eee!

Bluey: Penguin!

Bingo drops the chips, stands up straight with her arms at her sides and begins to waddle around.

Bingo: (imitating a penguin) De-de-de-de, de-de-de!

Bluey: (groans) This is hard work.

Bandit pops up from behind the kitchen counter.

Bandit: Um-dum-dum!

The scene changes to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo in, still doing their animal impressions.

Bluey: Maybe I'll turn you into slightly calmer animals. Peacocks!

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo stand up, lean forward, and hold their arms behind them.

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo: (imitating peacocks) Prrrrr. Prrrrr. Prrrr. Rrrrr.

Bluey sits down on a chair.

Bluey: Ahh. That's a bit better.

Bandit snaps open a paper fan held behind him, imitating a peacock's tail.

Bandit: Prrrr-rrrr. Prrrr. Prrrr.

Bandit smugly waves his "tail" in Chilli and Bingo's faces. Chilli looks annoyed, Bingo looks confused.

Chilli and Bingo: Prrr. Prrrr.

Bluey: Hey, mind your manners, Mr. Show-Off!

Bandit struts, getting closer to Chilli and Bingo, who both look worried now.

Bandit: PRRRRR! Prrrr!

Bluey gets up and runs in between them. She pushes Bandit back a few steps.

Bluey: Okay, you asked for it. Lions!

Chilli and Bingo get down on all fours, adopting fierce expressions.

Chilli: (imitating a lion) Roaaaar!

Bingo: (imitating a lion) Rar!

Bandit jumps backwards a step.

Bandit: (worried) Prrrr!

Bluey: (laughs) That will teach you to show off!

Chilli and Bingo lunge at Bandit, and chase him out into the yard.

Chilli: Roaaaar!

Bingo: Rar! Rar!

Bandit: Prrrrr!

Bluey: Nooooo! Don't go outside!

The scene changes to the yard, at the base of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: (panting) Where'd they go!

Bandit: Prrrr!

The camera pulls back to show Bandit has climbed up onto the lowest branch of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: There you are! Walrus!

Bandit falls out of the tree.

Bandit: Aaaaah! Oof! (groans)

The camera pulls back to show the whole yard. Bandit is now laying on his stomach. He blinks one eye and then the other.

Bluey: Now, where are those lions?

The camera pans to show Lucky's Dad's yard, which is partially un-mowed. The un-mowed portion has waist-high grass. Pat is is singing while hanging shirts on a drying rack.

Pat: (singing) One Sunday morning as I went walking/By Brisbane waters, I chanced to--

A twig snaps.

Pat: Oh! What was that?

The camera cuts to show Chilli and Bingo, hiding in the tall grass.

Chilli and Bingo: (growling) Mmmmmmmmm. Graar!

The camera cuts back to Pat.

Pat: Is that you, Lucky?

The camera cuts to a wide shot of the yard. Chilli and Bingo are not visible. The only sound is crickets chirping.

Pat: Oh, well, I guess it's nothing.

Chilli and Bingo pounce from the tall grass, tackling Pat around the legs.

Chilli and Bingo: Roaaaar!

Pat: Aaaah!

The camera cuts back to Bluey and Bandit. Bandit is now doing a walrus impression, holding himself up on his arms and with two protruding teeth like tusks. He continues blinking his eyes one at a time. Bluey is down on all fours, presumably trying to tell him something.

Pat: (continues screaming from offscreen) Janelle!

Bluey gets up and runs out of frame.

Bandit: (imitating a walrus) Mwoaaaar!

The camera cuts back to Pat's yard. Chilli and Bingo are gnawing on Pat's ankles and dragging him into the tall grass. He's digging his fingers into the ground to stay put but it's not helping.

Pat: Oh, Mrs. Heeler! Oh, I don't know about this! Aah!

Bluey emerges from the tall grass.

Bluey: Parrot!

Bingo crouches down and folds her arms at her sides like wings. Chilli continues to chew on Pat's ankle.

Bingo: (imitating a parrot) Squawk!

Bluey: Bunny!

Chilli crouches down with her arms in front of her.

Chilli: (imitating a rabbit) (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Polly want a cracker?

Pat crawls to the safety of the drying rack, panting.

Bluey: Get back in the house, you two!

Bluey herds Bingo and Chilli back towards their yard.

Bluey: Sorry Lucky's Dad!

Pat: No worries Bluey. (sounding ashamed) I shouldn't have let my guard down.

The scene changes back to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bingo, and Bandit into the room.

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Get in here, you lot!

Chilli: (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: That's it! You animals need to learn some manners.

Bandit butts his head into Bluey's shoulder.

Bandit: Rohh!

Bluey: Aah! Daddy Walrus! No doing that thing!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: First manners is...

Bingo: Polly want a cracker.

Bluey: (pointing at Bingo) Oh! First is, don't speak when someone's speaking!

Bingo: (sadly) Squawk.

Bluey: Second manners is...

Chilli: (clicks her tongue)

Chilli wanders off, hopping like a bunny.

Bluey: Hey! Worm!

Chilli stretches out and starts writhing from side to side.

Chilli: (imitating a worm) Eee! Mmmmmn! Mmmmn!

Bluey: No running away from manners lessons! Now, third one is... don't eat the next-door neighbors. That's a really important one. Hey, where's Daddy Walrus?

Bandit is missing. Bluey gasps, and Bandit grunts from offscreen. The camera cuts to the corner of the playroom, where Bandit is squatting on the rug in in front of a dollhouse, a look of intense concentration on his face.

Bluey: Nooooo!

Bluey puts her hands on her face as she screams, causing her to toss the asparagus, which lands by Bingo. Bluey runs out of frame towards Bandit.

Bingo: (looking at the asparagus) Squawk!

The scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey in the corner. Bandit is squinting with effort. Bluey runs in between him and the dollhouse, and pushes him away.

Bandit: (grunts)

Bluey: Fourth manners is--

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: don't go to the toilet on the rug!

Bluey pushes him back to the others. Bingo is chewing on the asparagus.

Bluey: (groans with effort) You big grub!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: This is hopeless. I'm gonna turn you all back into dogs. Where's my asparagus?

Bingo: (indistinctly) Polly want a cracker!

Bingo swallows the asparagus whole.

Bluey: Noooooooo!

Bluey runs over to Bingo, and pries her jaws open as far as she can.

Bingo: Daaaaah.

Bluey lets Bingo close her mouth.

Bluey: Oh, no! You're stuck like this forever!

Bandit headbutts Bluey in the shoulder again.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bingo: Squawk! Polly want more asparagus!

Bluey: Wait! I've got an idea!

The scene cuts to a close-up of Bingo, still imitating a parrot, seated at the dinner table.

Bingo: Squawk!

The camera cuts back to reveal Bandit, slumped over and barely on his chair, with Bluey supporting most of his weight. Chilli is sitting upright in her chair, but only because she's been tied in place with a jump rope.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: Okay, Bird Bingo, you've eaten the magic asparagus. Too late to change that. But I think if you say "doggie," everyone will turn back to doggies.

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: Can you say "Polly want a doggie"? Pretty please?

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Chilli: Mmmmn!

Bingo: Polly want a cracker!

Bluey: Ugh! No, "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit slaps Bluey with his "flipper".

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! Hands to yourself, Daddy Walrus! Come on, Bird Bingo! "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey manages to push Bandit upright in his chair.

Bluey: Oof!

Bandit, balanced precariously, teeters for a moment.

Bandit: Mwoar!

Bandit overbalances and falls out of his chair.

Bluey: Ugh!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey runs over and starts trying to lift Bandit into his chair again.

Bluey: Urgh! Come on, Bird Bingo! It's hard to get a walrus...

Bluey gets Bandit back into his chair.

Bluey: ...to sit at the dinner table!

Bingo: Polly want a... d... d...

Bluey: Yeah, yeah!

Bingo: Dinosaur!

Bandit and Chilli hold their arms in front of their chests like a T-Rex and snarl. Chilli is still tied to her chair.

Bandit and Chilli: (imitating a dinosaur) Roaaar! Roaaar!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, no! Doggie, doggie!

Bluey shakes Bingo for a second, before Bandit picks Bluey up and pretends to chomp on her stomach.

Bandit: Roaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! No eating your manners teacher!

Bandit: (still chomping) Raar! Raar!

Bluey: (screams)

Bingo: Polly want a...

Bluey: Help!

Bingo: Polly want a... doggie!

With a jerk, Bandit and Chilli return to normal.

Chilli: Huh?

Bluey: Hooray! You did it, Bird Bingo!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bandit: What's going on?

Bluey: Uh...

Chilli: (untying herself) Oh, uh... We're just eating dinner. Remember?

Bandit: Ah, yeah -- dinner. Okay, well, make sure you --

Bluey eats her last two pieces of broccoli in one bite.

Bluey: (formally) I've finished my vegetables, Father. I shall now excuse myself to go tidy the kitchen.

Bluey pushes in her chair and clears away her dishes. She winks at Chilli on the way past, and Chilli winks back.

Bluey: Pip, pip!

Bandit: Well. That's more like it.

Bingo: (still imitating a parrot) Squawk! Bawk, bawk, bawk!

Bingo pecks at her food, causing the plate to rattle loudly.

Bandit: Bingo, for the last time, use a knife and --

Bingo: Chicken!

Bandit stands bolt upright and holds his arms like wings.

Bandit: (imitating a chicken): Ba-kaw!

BBQ

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Chilli [angrily from off]: Whose muddy footprints are these?!

Cut to Bingo using the mop to clean up her footprints. Later, Muffin and Socks have cleared the salad and dressing off the bench to make way for Bluey's "sausages".

Muffin: More sausages please, Bluey.

Bluey: Here you go.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Bandit: Out of the way, salads!

Bandit pushes the salad bowls aside to make room for the sausages. Everyone except Bingo and Bandit starts complimenting Bandit on the sausages.

Bandit: Why thank you. Thank you very much.

Bingo, however, is frustrated.

Bingo [annoyed]: Isn't anyone going to mention the salads??

Pause. Everyone looks around nervously, before starting to praise Chilli and her salads.

Chilli [laughing]: Thank you, thank you.

They all laugh, Stripe affectionately rubbing the top of Bingo's head. Chilli hugs Bingo.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a chill groove with marimba and flute. Bluey is dancing.
