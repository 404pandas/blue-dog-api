Army
Jack: Mum!

Jack's mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!

Jack's mum: How was your first day at your new school?

Jack: Good.

Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.

Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.

Jack's dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?

Jack: Yes, Dad.

Jack's dad: Did you remember your hat?

Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?

Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!

(goat maahs)

Jack's dad: Jack, your hat?

Jack: I forgot it.

Jack's dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?

Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!

Jack's dad: Jaaaack.

Jack: Sorry, I forgot.

Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?

Jack: I don't know.

Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.

Calypso: Well, hello.

Calypso: You must be my new student.

Jack: I'm Jack.

Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.

Jack: Grr!

Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there. (the red kelpie Calypso is referring to is Rusty)

Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!

Jack's dad: You have fun, mate!

Jack: I will!

Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.

Jack: What are you playing?

Rusty: I'm playing army.

Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.

Jack: Can I be in the army?

Rusty: Well, maybe.

Rusty: Can you do as you're told?

Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...

Rusty: Attention!

Jack: Ah!

Rusty: On the left! Quick march!

Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: On the right!

Rusty: March! Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: Salute!

Rusty: Yeah, you can play.

Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.

Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier.

Rusty: You have to go through basic training.

Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.

Rusty: That's me.

Jack: Oh. Ok.

Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?

Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.

Rusty: You can use my spare.

Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.

Jack: Yes sergeant.

Rusty: Hup!

Jack: Hup!

(both laugh)

Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.

Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.

Rusty: Stop!

(Jack showing hand signals)

Jack: This one means "stop!"

Jack: This means "get down!"

Jack: This is "move over there."

(Jack stops showing hand signals)

Jack: Ha!

Coco: I'll get it! Huh?

Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.

Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.

Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.

Jack: Also, everything had a name.

Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.

Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.

Rusty: That blue gem is called Tango Seven.

Rusty: You got that?

Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.

Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.

Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.

Jack: A dust-off?

Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.

Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.

Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.

Jack: Grunts (while doing push-ups)

Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.

Jack: It's when you're a guard.

Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.

Jack: I loved it.

Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.

Jack: I was really good at sentry.

Rusty: You're really good at sentry.

Jack: Thanks, Sarge.

Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.

Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.

Jack: How do you know so much about the army?

Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.

Jack: Is he on patrol like us?

Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.

Jack: Oh, that's good.

Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.

Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!

Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.

(Rustling in grass)

(Rusty gasps)

(Rustling continues)

Rusty: Contact!

Jack: What do we do?

Rusty: Fall back!

(Both say Arrgh)

(Turkey gobbles)

Rusty: Get down!

(Jack grunts)

Rusty: There's too many of them!

Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!

Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.

Rusty: (speaking into a dotted cylindrical object) Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded!

Rusty: Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?

Jack: It was all down to me.

Jack: I had to remember what that tree was called.

Jack: Tango Five?

Jack: No, Tango Six?

Jack: Tango Seven!

Rusty: (speaking into object once again) We're next to Tango Seven, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven.

Rusty: LZ is no good!

Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.

Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!

Jack: How?

Rusty: Run!

Jack: One thing I can do is run.

Jack: I'm a Jack Russell!

(Jack zooms by Rusty)

Rusty: Whoa!

Rusty: Get to the chopper!

Jack: Ok!

Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.

Jack: We made it!

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

(Both laugh)

Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.

Rusty: Why did you come to this school?

Rusty: Was there something wrong with your old school.

Jack: No.

Jack. There's something wrong with me.

Jack: I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.

Rusty: Oh.

Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.

Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso.

Rusty: You're all safe.

Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.

Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.

Jack: I was in the army.

Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.

Jack: And then it was pick-up time.

Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.

Jack: And now I'm here.

Jack's mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.

Jack: Yeah.

Jack's mum: Good boy, Jack.

Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?

Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?

Jack: Rusty gave it to me.

Rusty: See you, Jack!

Rusty's dad: Hey! Rusty!

Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.

Asparagus
Bingo, Bandit, Bluey, and Chilli are eating dinner in the dining room. Bluey is loudly chewing with her mouth open.

Bluey: (chewing) Agh! Agh! Glargh!

Bluey points at Bingo with her fork.

Bluey: (incomprehensible with her mouth full) Bla-bl-bl-blah, bl-bloo!

Bandit: Bluey, don't talk with your mouth full and sit up straight, don't slouch, it's bad manners.

Bingo: (with mouth full) Is this bad manners? Blaaaaaaaah.

Bingo sticks out her tongue, with a wad of chewed food on it.

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: (giggles)

Bluey: Mum, why do we have to have manners?

Bandit: Because we're not animals.

Chili: I'm happy as long you eat your veggies.

Bandit: Hey, hey, hey! Elbows off the table, thanks Mum.

Chili: (scoffs) Ha!

Bandit: Can you believe that, kids? Ha!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggles)

Chili: (whispering) Psst, Bluey, take this, it's a magic asparagus.

Bluey: What does it do?

Chili: It turns people into any animal you want!

Bluey: For real life?

Chili: For real life.

Chilli hands Bluey the asparagus.

Bluey: Ooooh!

Bandit: Don't play with your food! Blu--

Bluey: (pointing the asparagus like a magic wand) Donkey!

Bandit gets down on his hands and knees.

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw!

Others: (laughter)

Bluey: It worked!

Bandit: Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bingo: Do me! Do me!

Bluey: Okay. Warthog!

Bingo: No, no, I want to be a piglet.

Bluey: Piglet!

Bingo snorts, then jumps down from the chair and begins to run around the room on all fours.

Bingo: (imitating a pig) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Eeee! Eee!

Chilli: Now that's taken care of, I need you to do a little something for me.

Bluey: Chicken!

Chilli stands up so quickly she knocks over her chair, holding her arms like wings.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Ba-kaw!

TITLE CARD: Asparagus

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Asparagus.

END TITLE CARD

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo enter the kitchen together, still doing their animal impressions. Bluey runs in after them.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Bawk! Bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk!

Bingo: (imitating a piglet) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bluey: Elephant!

Bandit stands up, and holds his arm in front of his face like a trunk. Bingo runs through his legs and offscreen.

Bandit: (imitating an elephant) Vrooooo! Vrooooo!

Bluey: I love this!

Bingo runs through the scene, still imitating a piglet.

Bingo: Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bluey: Here, chook, chook, chook!

Chilli: (approaching with a chicken walk) Bawk-bawk-bawk, braawk!

Bluey: Goat!

Chilli gets down on hands and knees. She's drawn with buck teeth and a shorter tail.

Chilli: (imitating a goat) N-e-eh! N-e-eh!

Chilli walks offscreen, and Bingo runs through the scene again

Bluey: Now, be free, my animal friends. No more rules for anyone.

Bingo runs through the scene again, and this time there's a crashing noise from offscreen. The camera pans over to show Bingo digging through a cupboard. Potato chips and a can of beans are spilled on the floor.

Bluey: Aaah! Pig Bingo, you're making a mess!

Bluey grabs Bingo by the waist and drags her out of the cupboard. Bingo struggles as Bluey tries to hold her down.

Bluey: Come here you wriggly little--

Bandit enters from offscreen and picks Bluey up with his "trunk". Bingo immediately dives back into the cupboard.

Bandit: Vroooo!

Bluey: Aaaaaah! Put me down! Aaah! Meerkat!

Bandit stands up on his tiptoes, arms held in front of him.

Bandit: (imitating a meerkat) Um-dum-dum! Hey! Hey!

Bluey: You can't just grab people and swing them around!

Bandit scampers to the fridge on all fours, then stands up to look around.

Bandit: Hey, hey!

Back on all fours, Bandit scampers out of the room.

Bluey: (laughs)

A dog toy squeaks from offscreen. The camera pans, and shows Chilli leaning on the kitchen counter, nibbling on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Polly Puppy! Mouse!

Chilli gets down on all fours and makes herself as small as she can.

Chilli: (imitating a mouse) Squeeeeak!

Bluey: You can't chew people's toys!

Chilli scratches her ear.

Bluey: It's not nice!

Chilli: Squeak! Squeak!

Bingo runs into the scene again, with an open bag of chips in her mouth.

Bingo: Eee!

Bluey: Penguin!

Bingo drops the chips, stands up straight with her arms at her sides and begins to waddle around.

Bingo: (imitating a penguin) De-de-de-de, de-de-de!

Bluey: (groans) This is hard work.

Bandit pops up from behind the kitchen counter.

Bandit: Um-dum-dum!

The scene changes to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo in, still doing their animal impressions.

Bluey: Maybe I'll turn you into slightly calmer animals. Peacocks!

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo stand up, lean forward, and hold their arms behind them.

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo: (imitating peacocks) Prrrrr. Prrrrr. Prrrr. Rrrrr.

Bluey sits down on a chair.

Bluey: Ahh. That's a bit better.

Bandit snaps open a paper fan held behind him, imitating a peacock's tail.

Bandit: Prrrr-rrrr. Prrrr. Prrrr.

Bandit smugly waves his "tail" in Chilli and Bingo's faces. Chilli looks annoyed, Bingo looks confused.

Chilli and Bingo: Prrr. Prrrr.

Bluey: Hey, mind your manners, Mr. Show-Off!

Bandit struts, getting closer to Chilli and Bingo, who both look worried now.

Bandit: PRRRRR! Prrrr!

Bluey gets up and runs in between them. She pushes Bandit back a few steps.

Bluey: Okay, you asked for it. Lions!

Chilli and Bingo get down on all fours, adopting fierce expressions.

Chilli: (imitating a lion) Roaaaar!

Bingo: (imitating a lion) Rar!

Bandit jumps backwards a step.

Bandit: (worried) Prrrr!

Bluey: (laughs) That will teach you to show off!

Chilli and Bingo lunge at Bandit, and chase him out into the yard.

Chilli: Roaaaar!

Bingo: Rar! Rar!

Bandit: Prrrrr!

Bluey: Nooooo! Don't go outside!

The scene changes to the yard, at the base of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: (panting) Where'd they go!

Bandit: Prrrr!

The camera pulls back to show Bandit has climbed up onto the lowest branch of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: There you are! Walrus!

Bandit falls out of the tree.

Bandit: Aaaaah! Oof! (groans)

The camera pulls back to show the whole yard. Bandit is now laying on his stomach. He blinks one eye and then the other.

Bluey: Now, where are those lions?

The camera pans to show Lucky's Dad's yard, which is partially un-mowed. The un-mowed portion has waist-high grass. Pat is is singing while hanging shirts on a drying rack.

Pat: (singing) One Sunday morning as I went walking/By Brisbane waters, I chanced to--

A twig snaps.

Pat: Oh! What was that?

The camera cuts to show Chilli and Bingo, hiding in the tall grass.

Chilli and Bingo: (growling) Mmmmmmmmm. Graar!

The camera cuts back to Pat.

Pat: Is that you, Lucky?

The camera cuts to a wide shot of the yard. Chilli and Bingo are not visible. The only sound is crickets chirping.

Pat: Oh, well, I guess it's nothing.

Chilli and Bingo pounce from the tall grass, tackling Pat around the legs.

Chilli and Bingo: Roaaaar!

Pat: Aaaah!

The camera cuts back to Bluey and Bandit. Bandit is now doing a walrus impression, holding himself up on his arms and with two protruding teeth like tusks. He continues blinking his eyes one at a time. Bluey is down on all fours, presumably trying to tell him something.

Pat: (continues screaming from offscreen) Janelle!

Bluey gets up and runs out of frame.

Bandit: (imitating a walrus) Mwoaaaar!

The camera cuts back to Pat's yard. Chilli and Bingo are gnawing on Pat's ankles and dragging him into the tall grass. He's digging his fingers into the ground to stay put but it's not helping.

Pat: Oh, Mrs. Heeler! Oh, I don't know about this! Aah!

Bluey emerges from the tall grass.

Bluey: Parrot!

Bingo crouches down and folds her arms at her sides like wings. Chilli continues to chew on Pat's ankle.

Bingo: (imitating a parrot) Squawk!

Bluey: Bunny!

Chilli crouches down with her arms in front of her.

Chilli: (imitating a rabbit) (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Polly want a cracker?

Pat crawls to the safety of the drying rack, panting.

Bluey: Get back in the house, you two!

Bluey herds Bingo and Chilli back towards their yard.

Bluey: Sorry Lucky's Dad!

Pat: No worries Bluey. (sounding ashamed) I shouldn't have let my guard down.

The scene changes back to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bingo, and Bandit into the room.

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Get in here, you lot!

Chilli: (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: That's it! You animals need to learn some manners.

Bandit butts his head into Bluey's shoulder.

Bandit: Rohh!

Bluey: Aah! Daddy Walrus! No doing that thing!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: First manners is...

Bingo: Polly want a cracker.

Bluey: (pointing at Bingo) Oh! First is, don't speak when someone's speaking!

Bingo: (sadly) Squawk.

Bluey: Second manners is...

Chilli: (clicks her tongue)

Chilli wanders off, hopping like a bunny.

Bluey: Hey! Worm!

Chilli stretches out and starts writhing from side to side.

Chilli: (imitating a worm) Eee! Mmmmmn! Mmmmn!

Bluey: No running away from manners lessons! Now, third one is... don't eat the next-door neighbors. That's a really important one. Hey, where's Daddy Walrus?

Bandit is missing. Bluey gasps, and Bandit grunts from offscreen. The camera cuts to the corner of the playroom, where Bandit is squatting on the rug in in front of a dollhouse, a look of intense concentration on his face.

Bluey: Nooooo!

Bluey puts her hands on her face as she screams, causing her to toss the asparagus, which lands by Bingo. Bluey runs out of frame towards Bandit.

Bingo: (looking at the asparagus) Squawk!

The scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey in the corner. Bandit is squinting with effort. Bluey runs in between him and the dollhouse, and pushes him away.

Bandit: (grunts)

Bluey: Fourth manners is--

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: don't go to the toilet on the rug!

Bluey pushes him back to the others. Bingo is chewing on the asparagus.

Bluey: (groans with effort) You big grub!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: This is hopeless. I'm gonna turn you all back into dogs. Where's my asparagus?

Bingo: (indistinctly) Polly want a cracker!

Bingo swallows the asparagus whole.

Bluey: Noooooooo!

Bluey runs over to Bingo, and pries her jaws open as far as she can.

Bingo: Daaaaah.

Bluey lets Bingo close her mouth.

Bluey: Oh, no! You're stuck like this forever!

Bandit headbutts Bluey in the shoulder again.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bingo: Squawk! Polly want more asparagus!

Bluey: Wait! I've got an idea!

The scene cuts to a close-up of Bingo, still imitating a parrot, seated at the dinner table.

Bingo: Squawk!

The camera cuts back to reveal Bandit, slumped over and barely on his chair, with Bluey supporting most of his weight. Chilli is sitting upright in her chair, but only because she's been tied in place with a jump rope.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: Okay, Bird Bingo, you've eaten the magic asparagus. Too late to change that. But I think if you say "doggie," everyone will turn back to doggies.

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: Can you say "Polly want a doggie"? Pretty please?

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Chilli: Mmmmn!

Bingo: Polly want a cracker!

Bluey: Ugh! No, "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit slaps Bluey with his "flipper".

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! Hands to yourself, Daddy Walrus! Come on, Bird Bingo! "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey manages to push Bandit upright in his chair.

Bluey: Oof!

Bandit, balanced precariously, teeters for a moment.

Bandit: Mwoar!

Bandit overbalances and falls out of his chair.

Bluey: Ugh!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey runs over and starts trying to lift Bandit into his chair again.

Bluey: Urgh! Come on, Bird Bingo! It's hard to get a walrus...

Bluey gets Bandit back into his chair.

Bluey: ...to sit at the dinner table!

Bingo: Polly want a... d... d...

Bluey: Yeah, yeah!

Bingo: Dinosaur!

Bandit and Chilli hold their arms in front of their chests like a T-Rex and snarl. Chilli is still tied to her chair.

Bandit and Chilli: (imitating a dinosaur) Roaaar! Roaaar!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, no! Doggie, doggie!

Bluey shakes Bingo for a second, before Bandit picks Bluey up and pretends to chomp on her stomach.

Bandit: Roaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! No eating your manners teacher!

Bandit: (still chomping) Raar! Raar!

Bluey: (screams)

Bingo: Polly want a...

Bluey: Help!

Bingo: Polly want a... doggie!

With a jerk, Bandit and Chilli return to normal.

Chilli: Huh?

Bluey: Hooray! You did it, Bird Bingo!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bandit: What's going on?

Bluey: Uh...

Chilli: (untying herself) Oh, uh... We're just eating dinner. Remember?

Bandit: Ah, yeah -- dinner. Okay, well, make sure you --

Bluey eats her last two pieces of broccoli in one bite.

Bluey: (formally) I've finished my vegetables, Father. I shall now excuse myself to go tidy the kitchen.

Bluey pushes in her chair and clears away her dishes. She winks at Chilli on the way past, and Chilli winks back.

Bluey: Pip, pip!

Bandit: Well. That's more like it.

Bingo: (still imitating a parrot) Squawk! Bawk, bawk, bawk!

Bingo pecks at her food, causing the plate to rattle loudly.

Bandit: Bingo, for the last time, use a knife and --

Bingo: Chicken!

Bandit stands bolt upright and holds his arms like wings.

Bandit: (imitating a chicken): Ba-kaw!

BBQ

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Chilli [angrily from off]: Whose muddy footprints are these?!

Cut to Bingo using the mop to clean up her footprints. Later, Muffin and Socks have cleared the salad and dressing off the bench to make way for Bluey's "sausages".

Muffin: More sausages please, Bluey.

Bluey: Here you go.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Bandit: Out of the way, salads!

Bandit pushes the salad bowls aside to make room for the sausages. Everyone except Bingo and Bandit starts complimenting Bandit on the sausages.

Bandit: Why thank you. Thank you very much.

Bingo, however, is frustrated.

Bingo [annoyed]: Isn't anyone going to mention the salads??

Pause. Everyone looks around nervously, before starting to praise Chilli and her salads.

Chilli [laughing]: Thank you, thank you.

They all laugh, Stripe affectionately rubbing the top of Bingo's head. Chilli hugs Bingo.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

Bluey: Mum, am I better at the monkey bars than Bingo?

Chilli: Well, you are two years older than her, Bluey.

Bluey: Am I better than Judo?

Chilli: You're about the same as Judo.

Bluey: I'm not! Judo cant do skip bar or backwards one bar.

Chilli: Well, she'll get there one day.

Bluey: But am I better than her on this day?

Chilli: Bluey, just run your own race.

Bluey: Huh? What does that mean?

Chilli: Come here. Have I told you the story of when you took your first steps?

Bluey: Oh, no!

Chilli: Well, it all started when you were still a baby.

(The camera shows a baby version of Bluey. She is wearing a red nappy and is lying on the floor, drooling on the rug, making baby noises)

(Bandit is also here too and he is drooling like Baby Bluey, Chilli is then see holding a baby rattle to catch Baby Bluey's attention.)

Chilli: Come on, Bluey. Roll over. Rollover! (Baby Bluey stops drooling, sees her mom and rolls over to one side)

Chilli (present): You learned to roll over really early. (Baby Bluey coos as we see a first person view of herself.)

Chilli (past): BANDIT!!! She rolled over!! She rolled over!! She's not meant to do that for ages!!

Bandit: Aw, that's my girl!

(Baby Bluey pushes Bandit to the side, she then laughs)

Bingo: Hang on, where was I?

Chilli: You weren't born yet, sweetheart.

Bingo: Ooh, I was invisible!

Bluey: Were you proud of me for rolling over so soon?

Chilli: Yes. A little too proud. (The camera goes to Nana's house. Bandit is seen dragging Baby Bluey to change her nappy while Nana and Chilli have some tea). I think I may have turned into a bit of a show off.

Nana: Oh, I've never heard of a baby rolling over that early!

Chilli (past): I know!

Nana: She's just special.

Bandit (past):(he coughs, the camera goes to mothers group where we see baby versions of Coco, Snickers and Judo. All of them are looking at their mums happily while making sounds. )

Chilli: But then one day at Mothers' Group...

Chilli (past): It is very early to roll over.

Bella: Oh, you're so clever, Bluey! (The look to their right and noticed something. We pan to see Snickers and Judo. Judo is the one who is sitting up while Snickers is seen laying down on the ground)

Wendy: Woah! She's sitting, She's sitting! Oh, Judo, you're sitting all by yourself! (Baby Judo giggles)

Snickers' mum: Oh, goodness, that's very early to be sitting!

Wendy: Oh, well, you know, it's not a race.

Bluey: But it was a race.

Bingo: A baby race!

(Episode title card)

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Baby Race.

(We go to another flashback. Chilli is seen holding Baby Bluey in her hands while Bandit is seen working on something)

Chilli: I don't know what got into me, but I was determined I'd get you walking before Judo's mum...I mean, Judo.

Chilli (past): There you go...steady...Bandit! She's sitting!

Bandit (past): Huh? Ack!

Chilli (past): Good gi-ah! (Baby Bluey suddenly falls down on the ground. She laughs very loudly)

(We go back to mother's group. This time the babies are sitting up, just like Baby Bluey).

Chilli: But after a lot of practice, eventually, you set up.

Bella: Bluey, you're sitting!

Baby Bluey: (she laughs, the two noticed Judo again. This time she is crawling while Wendy tries to catch up with her)

Wendy: Judo! Oh, goodness, I just can't keep track of her!

Baby Bluey: (mumbles, she then falls and laughs)

Bluey: Judo crawled before me as well?!

Bingo: Judo beat you again!

Bluey: And just what did you do about this?

Chilli: Well, I tried my best.

Bandit (past)(background): This thing is heavy!

Chilli (past):(claps) Come on, Bluey, crawl to Mama! You can do it, you can do it!

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did Bluey crawl?

(Baby Bluey rolls across the floor, she then laughs again)

Chilli: Not exactly.

Bluey:(laughs) Why was I rolling?

Chilli: I don't know, kid. You didn't come with instructions.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just roll before they crawl.

(Baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton dog and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Bandit (past)(background)(singing): 99 bottles of thing on the wall...

Chilli (past): Aha!

(Cut to living room area)

Chilli (past): It's fun to crawl. (Baby Bluey giggles as she sees this) Oh, how good is crawling? It's better than rolling.

Bandit (past): (falls on Bluey's toy) YOW! My knees! Baby Bluey laughs very loudly)

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Chilli: Not exactly.

Chilli (past): Come on, Bluey! You can do it! Crawl to me!

(Baby Bluey looks like she's going to crawl, but then bum shuffles to Chilli as she giggles to her)

Bandit (past): Woo hoo, yeah! Bum shuffle!

Bluey: Bum shuffle?!

Chilli: Bum shuffle.

(Cut to Mothers' Group where Baby Bluey is seen bum shuffling to meet her baby friends)

Chilli: You were a bum shuffler.

(As Baby Bluey bum shuffles, Coco is seen crawling to the right and to the left, Snickers is about to crawl, but he sees Baby Bluey bum shuffling and Judo is seen getting on top of a stool)

Bella: Woo hoo! Go Bluey!

Chilli: Meanwhile, Judo was pulling herself up on furniture, which is the step right before walking.

Bluey: And I was just bum shuffling around?!

Bingo: You are definitely not winning the baby race.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just bum shuffle before they crawl.

(Again, baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Chilli (past): See, feels good, doesn't it? Feels like you wanna crawl, right?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Mum: Yes!!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!!

Chilli: Backwards! (Baby Bluey suddenly crawls backwards as she giggles)

Bandit (past): (laughs) Beep, beep, beep!

(Bingo laughs while Bluey facepalms)

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about. (Baby Bluey giggles again)

(Cut to Nana's house)

Chilli: But Nana wasn't having that.

Nana: Let's stop mucking around, eh? A bit of olive oil on those knees will do the trick.

Chilli (past): But how is olive oil gonna-oh my goodness!

Bandit (past): Mum, what are you doing?!

Nana: If she can't crawl, she'll have to walk.

Bandit (past): This isn't legal anymore!

Nana: I'll sprinkle some grit down, too. Oh, where'd they go?

(Bluey and Bingo laugh)

Chilli: Your Nana's old school.

(Cut to Mothers' Group, this time the Babies, expect for Bluey, who is still crawling backwards are walking. Baby Snickers suddenly falls on his butt.)

Chilli: None of it mattered, though. Judo had won the baby race.

(Cut to present)

Bingo: Oh, biscuits.

Bluey: Were you upset with me that I lost the baby race?

Chilli: No, sweetie. Look, we were all learning to do things for the first time.

(Cut to balcony)

Chilli: I just felt like I was doing everything wrong.

Bandit (past): Aren't you going to Mothers' Group?

Chilli (past): (sighs)

(Cut to Mothers' Group. While Wendy and Snicker's mum talk about the hat that Snickers usually wears, Baby Coco makes a sound, shocking and distracting Bella.)

Snickers' mum: It's a cute hat, It's kinda like he was born with it.

(Cut to porch. Bella is seen holding her purse and Baby Coco as Baby Bluey plays with leaves.)

Chilli: But then, one day, Coco's mum came to see me.

Bella: Hi, Chilli.

Chilli (past): Bella! Oh, hello. I'm so sorry, the house is a mess.

Chilli: We chatted for a while and then she showed me a photo.

Chilli (past): Are these all your children?

Bella: Yep!

Chilli (past): I thought Coco was your first.

Bella: No, I've got eight kids! Wait, no. Nine.

Chilli (past): I had no idea! Wow... you must have learned a thing or two.

Bella: I have. And there's something you need to know.

Chilli (past): What?

Bella: You're doing great.

(Chilli tears up and embraces Bella. Cut to present.)

Chilli: (sniffles)

Bingo: Are they happy tears, Mum?

Chilli: (voice breaking) Yeah. Happy tears, honey.

(Cut to living room)

Chilli: From then on, I decided to run my own race.

Chilli (past): Whoa, whoa, whoa, yay! Bluey wins!

(Cut to Mothers' Group, Judo walks up to Chilli as she makes a sound)

Baby Judo: Oobi!

Chilli (past): Well done, Judo, you clever girl! (We show a close up of Baby Judo, there is a pink bow on her head and there are hearts on her diaper.)

Bingo: So, did Bluey ever learn to walk?

Chilli: Yes, honey. In the kitchen, actually.

(Cut to kitchen, Bluey pulls herself up and walks to Chilli)

Bluey: Why did I decide to walk in the kitchen?

Chilli: I don't know, sweetie.

(As the episode nears its end, Chilli sees Baby Bluey walking and reaches to pick her up with tears in her eyes.)

Bingo: Maybe you just saw something you wanted.

The episode starts at Calypso's school. The shot cuts to the main classroom, where all the pups are gathered around by Calypso.

Calypso: "Okay class, something very special is happening today!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "What is it?"

Bluey and Mackenzie look at each other after saying the same thing in unintentional unison. Winton scoots up next to Bluey.

Winton: "Oooh! Bluey's gonna marry Mackenzie!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "No we're not!"

Calypso: "You're going to see your buddies!"

The Pups: "Hooray!"

Calypso: "Now, go to the special place where you meet them."

The pups laugh as they all run off. The shot cuts to Bluey running to her buddy, sitting on a hill resting underneath a tree.

Bluey: "Mia!"

Mia: "Bluey!"

Mia and Bluey hug each other.

Bluey: "Can we build a fairy garden?"

Mia: "Okay, let's go!"

The shot cuts to Mackenzie meeting his buddy.

Mackenzie: "Captain!"

Captain: "Mackenzie!"

The two do a unique handshake.

Mackenzie: "Can we play barky boats?"

Captain: "Okay!"

EPISODE TITLE: Barky Boats

Calypso: "This episode of Bluey is called Barky Boats."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia, who run down the hill, joyfully laughing.

Bluey: "Mia? Can I show you my cartwheel?"

Mia: "Go for it!"

Bluey proceeds to do a cartwheel, impressing Mia.

Mia: "Wow! You've been practicing! Watch mine!"

Mia does her cartwheel, landing in a split.

Bluey: "Whoa!"

Mia: "Come on! I'll race you!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Mia race after one another, heading to the forest where their fairy garden resides. The shot cuts to Mackenzie and Captain sitting by a small pond canal. Mackenzie grabs some wood bark chips scattered about the ground.

Captain: "I'll make the dam!"

Mackenzie: "Here's a good one!"

Captain: "Oh yeah, that'll go fast!"

Just then, Bluey and Mia run by as Mackenzie is busy sharpening a bark chip to refine the shape.

Captain: "Hi Mia. Hi Mia! HI MIA!"

Mia: "Oh! Hi Captain!"

Captain: "What are you up to?"

Mia: "Bluey and I are gonna go build a fairy garden. What are you doing?"

Captain: "We're playing barky boats!"

Mia: "Oh, okay. Have fun. Bye!"

Captain: "Bye, Mia!"

Bluey and Mackenzie stick their tongue out at each other, showing they have a light rivalry with one another. After Bluey and Mia leave, Mackenzie runs back with the barky boat.

Mackenzie: "Okay, let it go!"

Captain moves his hands away from the dam, causing the water to flood out as the barky boat travels down the canal.

Mackenzie & Captain: "Yeah! Look at it go!"

The boat reaches the end, a wave of new water overlapping with the pond at the end of the canal.

Mackenzie: "Again!"

Captain: "Hey, uhh, Mackenzie? Do you wanna help Bluey build a fairy garden?"

Mackenzie: "...No?"

Captain: "Ah, okay."

The shot cuts to Bluey and Mia in the forest, running to a secluded space with a small stream of water running through.

Bluey: "Let's build it here!"

Bluey grabs a log, and Mia grabs a couple leaves.

Bluey: "This can be the bridge."

Mia: "These can be the trees!"

Bluey and Mia do more work on the fairy garden, setting up houses out of the resources around the forest. Mia helps Bluey pick a couple plants off of the trees, and then the shot cuts to a more complete fairy garden.

Bluey: "How old are you?"

Mia: "Twelve!"

Bluey: "Wow. Can you drive a car?"

Mia: "Hehehe! No, not yet!"

Bluey: "When do you start big school?"

Mia: "Next year."

Bluey: "Are you nervous about big school?"

Mia's smile slightly drops into a worried frown.

Mia: "No, it's gonna be great!"

Bluey: "Ooh, can you write words?"

Mia: "Yeah!"

Bluey: "Can you write a letter to the fairies?"

Mia: "Okay, go for it!"

Bluey: "Okay, um. Dear fairies--"

Mackenzie and Captain enter, alerting Bluey and Mia.

Captain: "Hi!"

Bluey: "Aah! Ugh, Mackenzie, what are you doing here?"

Mackenzie: "He made me come!"

Mia: "Explain yourself!"

Captain: "Oh, I...I thought there might be some good bark here for our barky boats."

Bluey: "Well, there's not, now shoo!"

Mackenzie: "I told you! Come on, let's go!"

Mia: "Bye!"

Bluey: "Ugh, that was close! Okay, dear fairies: Dad bought new grass, but it had ants in it, and he couldn't find the ant powder, and Mum was like 'Where'd you last have it?' He said--"

Mia gets sidetracked and pulls up a piece of bark.

Mia: "Oh! Look! Do you think this would make a good barky boat?"

Bluey: "Uhhh, I guess?"

Mia: "Do you just wanna just quickly give it to Mackenzie?"

Bluey: "No!"

Mia: "Come on Bluey, I'll race you!"

Mia runs off, but Bluey hesitantly waits behind, worried she's leaving her behind to hang out with Captain and Mackenzie. The shot cuts back to the two other buddies, playing another round of barky boats.

Mackenzie: "Keep letting the water build up!"

Captain: "Okay."

Mackenzie: "And no running off!"

Captain: "Yeah, okay. I don't know what I was thinking."

Mia enters, alerting the two.

Mia: "Hi!"

Captain: "Aah!"

Captain jumps, scared by Mia's sudden appearance. causing the built-up water to flood out, splashing Mackenzie in the face.

Mackenzie: "Aah!"

Captain: "Sorry, Mackenzie!"

Bluey enters, looking annoyed.

Mackenzie: "What are you doing here?!"

Bluey: "She made me come.."

Mia: "I thought you might like this barky boat?"

Captain: "Aw, thanks! That's a good one!"

Mackenzie: "It's not that good.."

Bluey: "It's gooder than yours!"

Mackenzie: "Is not!"

Mia: "I can find a better one!"

Captain: "I'll help you."

Mia: "Okay!"

Mia & Captain: "We'll be right back!"

The two run off, leaving Bluey and Mackenzie alone.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Awww..."

Some time passes, Bluey and Mackenzie sulk by the barky boats pond. Just then, Calypso enters!

Calypso: "Aw, Bluey! Mackenzie! Where are your buddies?"

Bluey: "They ran away from us!"

Calypso: "Oh, goodness me."

Bluey: "Don't they like us?"

Calypso: "Of course they do! But, it can be hard being twelve years old, sometimes."

Bluey: "What do you mean?"

Calypso: "Here, give me those barky boats. I'll show you something. Go on, hold the water back."

Bluey and Mackenzie both hold the water back, causing it to build up.

Calypso: "There once were two six year-old buddies floating around, nice and calm, not a care in the world! They turned seven years old, then eight years old, then nine, then ten, and eleven, and then...!"

Mackenzie: "I can't hold it any longer!"

Bluey: "Look out!"

The two let go of the dam, causing the water to flood out at high speeds and for the two barky boats to go travelling down.

Calypso: "Twelve! Off they went, on a big adventure! Hang on, buddies!"

Bluey & Mackenzie:' "Yeah, hang on, buddies!"

Calypso: "They went this way, and that way..."

The boats begin to drift due to the surging rush of water, with them coming close to falling out.

Mackenzie: "Aah! Are they gonna make it?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

The barky boats continue down the canal, before finally landing in the pond at the end of the path safely.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Yeah! They made it!"

Calypso: "Hooray!"

Bluey: "And they lived happily ever after."

Calypso: "Just be patient, children. Your buddies haven't forgotten you."

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Okay, Calypso!"

Now back with Captain and Mia, they walk into a empty part of the forest, with a fruit tree.

Mia: "Maybe there's some barky boats around here."

Captain: "Yeah, there usually is."

Mia: "Ooh! Lillie-pillies! Let's pick some for our buddies!"

Captain: "Okay!"

The two pick some lillie-pillies.

Captain: "What's your favorite fruit?"

Mia: "Uhh, lychees! What's yours?"

Captain: "I like mangoes."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mackenzie. Now with Calypso gone they're back to waiting for their buddies to return.

Mackenzie: "Are you going to go back to your fairy garden?"

Bluey: "Uh, no. It's not as much fun without my buddy."

Mackenzie: "Yeah, same...Wanna play barky boats with me?"

Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"

Mackenzie: "We can race our buddies!"

Bluey and Mackenzie ready their barky boats.

Bluey: "Ready? One, two, three, go!"

Mackenzie: "Wooo!"

Bluey: "Go, Mia!"

The shot cuts to Mia and Captain, now lying on the forest floor, resting under the sun.

Mia: "Are you nervous about starting high school?"

Captain: "A little."

Mia: "Me too...at least we'll be there together!"

As the two smile and their tails wag, the shouts of their buddies can be heard in the distance.

Captain & Mia: "Our buddies!"

Bluey: "Noo, Mia won!"

Mackenzie: "No she didn't, Captain won!"

Bluey: "No he didn't!"

Mackenzie: "Yes, he did!"

The two blow raspberries at each other. Soon after they burst into laughter with one another. Mia and Captain run back.

Captain: "We're back!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Hooray!"

Mia: "We're so sorry, Bluey! I don't know what happened..."

Captain: "We were looking for barky boats..."

Mia: "And went down this way, and that way and--"

Captain: "And we found some lillie-pillies, and then I...I don't know what happened!"

Bluey: "That's okay! You made it back!"

Bluey hugs Mia, and Mackenzie does a fist-bump with Captain.

Mia: "Come on Bluey, let's finish the fairy letter!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Before Bluey goes to hop on Mia's back, ready to leave for the fairy garden again, she stops and looks over to Mackenzie and Captain. She runs over to hug Mackenzie.

Bluey: "See 'ya, Mackenzie!"

Mackenzie: "See 'ya, Bluey!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Bluey and Mia leave. Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Captain run back to the barky boats pond.

Captain: "Alright, come on! Let's do the biggest dam ever!"

Mackenzie: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia. The fairy garden is complete, and Mia is ready to continue with Bluey's letter to the fairies.

Mia: "Okay, ready Bluey!"

Bluey: "Dear fairies: Dad bought new grass. It had ants! I love my buddy Mia, cause she can do the splits, and she gives me piggybacks."

Mia: "Oh, I love giving you piggybacks!"

Bluey: "Please get the ants out of Dad's grass, and also look after Mia when she goes to big school, even though she isn't scared."

Mia stops writing, and begins tearing up at Bluey's words and the feeling that she is heading off to high school soon.

Bluey: "And make sure she doesn't forget to come and play with me. Kiss kiss kiss, hug hug h-"

Mia hugs Bluey, with Bluey smiling in return.

Bingo: Ow! Awww... I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again.

Bluey: And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her.

Bandit: (grabs her arm) Hang on, not so fast.

Bandit (offscreen): Let's just see what happens next.

Trivia
This episode is a one-time spin-off of the entire series as it focuses primarily on Bluey's sister, Bingo.
Bingo gets her own title card, intro and outro in this episode. She says "This episode of Bingo is called "Bingo"" instead of "This episode of Bluey is called "Bingo"".
Chilli says “sweet as, Bingo”, in a Kiwi accent, a reference to what country the Kiwi animal lives in.
Bingo breaks the fourth wall when she looks at the camera and tells her answer for "I Spy", which in this case, is a rug.
It is revealed that Bingo loves to eat raspberries and blueberries.
The soundtrack that plays throughout this episode is Mozart's Sonata No. 16.
This episode's inspirational poster is based on a movie poster for Home Alone.
This is the 1st instance of a sound effect in the title card.
Bandit's response "Not again!" to the missing New Zealand piece is a possible reference to the countless times NZ has been left off world maps. Including the game board for Risk™ and on a map in an episode of Star Trek.
Long Dog: This version of the dog is teal with a purple nose and is reading a newspaper. It can be seen on the right side of the screen during the scene where Chilli comforts Bingo in the playroom closet.

Script.jpg
The episode opens in a grassy meadow. Bandit is laying on his back on a picnic blanket. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are approaching him. They have all drawn faces on their right hands, with markers and googly eyes. Bingo's hand is also decorated with a flower crown and feather wings. They walk their fingers over the picnic blanket, using their hands as puppets.

Chilli: Once, there were two sisters:

The episode cuts to an extreme close up on their hands, giving us a puppets-eye view. Chilli's puppet has a frown and worried expression. Bluey's is smiling. Bluey's puppet picks up a fork.

Chilli: [voiceover] Big Sister --

Chilli: (as Big Sister) Hi!

Chilli: [voiceover] And Little Sister.

Bluey: (as Little Sister) Hi!

Bingo: [voiceover] And also, a little fairy.

Chilli: [voiceover] Oh, yes! And also, a little fairy.

Little Sister spins in a circle, flailing her fork.

Little Sister: Eeee!

Big Sister: Whoa! Be careful, Little Sister! You'll have someone's eye out with that thing.

Little Sister drops the fork.

Little Sister: And the Big Sister was no fun at all.

Big Sister: Hey! I'm lots of fun!

Little Sister: Nuh-uh!

Chilli: [voiceover] Anyway, it was winter and very cold.

Big Sister: Brrrr! We need to find somewhere warm to sleep, little sister!

Bingo: (as Little Fairy) I know a place that's got the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Sister: Where are they, Little Fairy?

Little Fairy: Beyond the Blue Mountains!

An extreme low-angle shot of Bandit's feet, knees, and stomach, framing them as a mountain range.

Little Sister: Yay! The Blue Mountains!

TITLE CARD - Blue Mountains

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called the Blue Mountains.

Back to the opening shot, showing whole characters.

Chilli: (as Big Sister) No way are we going to the Blue Mountains.

Cut back to the puppets-eye view.

Big Sister: It's too dangerous!

Little Sister: I told you she was no fun. Race you!

Bingo: (giggles)

Big Sister: Hey!

Little Sister and Little Fairy run off together. They stop when they encounter Bandit's tail.

Little Sister: Whoa, look!

Big Sister hides behind a sandwich.

Big Sister: Stay back, Little Sister! We don't know what that is!

Little Sister: (giggles) Don't worry. It's friendly.

Little Sister briefly lifts up the tail and lets it drop.

Big Sister: Brrr! We'd best get going.

Cut to Bandit's foot. Little Sister and Little Fairy leap onto his foot and begin climbing his leg.

Little sister: Hooray!

Cut to Bandit's shin. Little Sister is skipping backwards up the slope.

Big Sister: This is too steep.

Little sister: Oh, big sister, don't be a stick in the mud.

Cut to Bandit's knee. The girls enjoy a panoramic view.

Big Sister: (gasps)

Little Sister: What a view!

Big Sister: How do we get down?

Little Fairy: We slide! Whee!

Little Sister: Whee!

They both slide down Bandit's thigh. Big sister hesitates.

Big Sister: Okay. Here we goooo!

Big Sister also slides down. We cut back to Chilli.

Chilli: (laughs)

Chilli licks her finger and erases Big Sister's frown, then draws a smile on instead. Back in puppet-vision, Big Sister is sliding down Bandit's thigh.

Big Sister: Whee! Yeah! That was fun!

The three of them are bouncing on Bandit's belly.

Little Sister: It's so soft and squishy!

Big Sister: It _is_ soft and squishy, isn't it, little sister? It's like we're bouncing on a massive pikelet.

Bandit: (growls)

As Bandit growls, the screen shakes and rumbling sound effects suggest an earthquake.

Little Sister: What's happening?

Bandit folds his arms, creating a massive wall across his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Little Sister: How are we gonna get past this big wall?

Big Sister: It's too high to climb!

Little Sister: We'll never find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Fairy: My sweeties, there's a secret spot somewhere here. We just have to find it.

Big Sister: Oh, yes! And if we scratch it, it makes the wall come tumbling down.

Little Sister: Hee, okay!

Big Sister: You try over there.

Little Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs lightly. Big Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs harder. Little Fairy tickles Bandit. He laughs even harder.

Little Sister: This is the spot!

Big Sister and Little Fairy come and tickle the same spot.

Little Fairy: Yeah, that's the spot!

Big Sister: You got it!

Bandit laughs and raises his arms. All three begin running towards his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Big Sister: Run for your lives!

Bandit's arms slam back down behind them.

All: Hooray!

They dance and laugh.

Big Sister: Yeah! Oh, I'm having so much fun, little sister. Maybe I do just need to relax and enjoy myself more. I wonder why I ever stopped in the first place.

Bandit: (offscreen) Well, hello!

Bandit's hand puppet appears. He's stuck a nose and tail on his hand, and drawn pointy ears on his wrist. He's even given his puppet shoes and a monobrow.

Bandit: (as the fox) I am a kindly fox.

Big Sister: Oh, look at this cute little fella.

The Fox: You wouldn't be looking for the warmest, softest beds in the whole world, would you?

Big Sister: We are!

The Fox: Well, you're in luck. I can show you the way.

Big Sister: Oh, great! Did you hear that, kids?

Little Sister: Big sister, I think he's a cheeky fox.

Big Sister: A what?! No, he's a kindly fox. He said so. Ooh, look at his cute little tail.

The camera cuts to the fox doing leg stretches. His right eye falls off, and he puts it back on. When the camera cuts back, Little Sister is frowning.

Little Sister: I'm not so sure.

Big Sister: Oh, come on, little sister. Now who's being boring?

Little Sister: Hey!

Little Fairy: Little sister, we need to find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world, otherwise, we'll freeze.

Little Sister: Oh, all right.

Big Sister: Okay, kindly fox. We'd love you to show us the way.

The Fox: Oh, very good! Right this way.

Bandit hums as they walk across his chest. Big Sister addresses the fox privately as they walk.

Big Sister: I'm usually a real worry wart, but this trek to the Blue Mountains has really shown me how to relax and have fun.

The Fox: Oh, splendid!

Little Sister: I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.

The Fox: That sister of yours is hard work, isn't she?

Big Sister: She sure is.

They arrive at Bandit's open mouth.

Little Sister: It's a cave!

Big Sister: Oh, wow, it stinks!

The Fox: (muffled, as Bandit is trying not to move his mouth) I'm sure it's not that bad.

Big Sister: Oh, Kindly Fox, is there something wrong with your voice?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, no, I just like to talk like this sometimes.

Big Sister: Very strange. Well, we best get going. Are you coming, too, Kindly Fox?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, I actually have to go and buy some more... hand cream.

Big Sister: Okay. Thanks for your help.

The Fox: (muffled) Yep. In you go.

The Fox leaves.

Little Sister: I'm not sure this is a good idea.

Big Sister: Oh, quiet, Little Sister. Now who's a stick in the mud? Last one into the cave's a rotten egg!

Big sister runs towards the cave; Little Sister and Little Fairy chase her.

Big Sister: Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!

She reaches Bandit's mouth, which slams shut on her. Saliva sprays everywhere.

Big Sister: (muffled) Aaah!

Little Fairy and Litte Sister: (gasp)

Little Fairy: Big Sister!

Big Sister: (muffled) Help, Little Sister!

Chilli: (out of character, laughing) He's licking me!

Big Sister: (muffled) Let me out!

Little Sister: It was a trick! What are you gonna do?!

The Fox: (laughs)

Little Sister: You! You are a cheeky fox! That's it. No one traps my big sister. Hyah!

Little Sister picks up The Fox, and with Little Fairy's help, throws him. He lands with his legs lodged in Bandit's nostrils.

Little Sister: Wait for it! Wait for it!

Bandit: Bleahh!

Bandit, unable to breathe, spits out Big Sister, and sends The Fox flying into the sun.

All: Yeah!

The sisters and fairy land on the picnic blanket. Big Sister is covered in spit. Her eye falls off, and she puts it back on.

Big Sister: Ew. I'm all slimy!

Little Sister: Big sister! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

They embrace, wetly.

Little Sister: I promise I'll never say you're boring ever again.

Big Sister: Oh, I was so busy trying to be fun, I forgot the most important thing big sisters are meant to do.

Little Sister: What's that?

Big Sister: Look after their little sisters.

Little Fairy: Look!

Little Fairy points to Bandit's ears.

Little Sister: The softest, warmest beds in the whole world!

Big Sister: Yeah!

Little Fairy: We found them! Hooray!

Big Sister: Oh, it's so soft. And look, there's enough wax in here to make a hundred candles!

Bandit pokes Big Sister with the tip of his ear.

Big Sister: Ohh!

Bluey, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit all laugh.

The puppets are shown sleeping under Bandit's ear.

Chilli: [voiceover] And they all slept happily ever after.

Bluey: "Bob, this is Mixed-up Murphy, he's really funny."

Bingo: "Yea. Really funny."

Chilli: "Oh, Bingo.."

Now outside, a saddened Bingo sits under the tree holding Bob Bilby. Chilli, Bandit and Bluey enter, with Chilli coming to sit beside her.

Chilli: "Are you alright, Bingo?"

Bingo: "This is the most boring time Bob's had in the whole book."

Chilli: "No, that's not true, kiddo!"

Bluey looks at the pictures they've taken with Bob.

Bluey: "Yeah, it is!"

Bingo begins to tear up again.

Bingo: "I'm the worst friend Bob's got. He's never going to want to visit again."

Chilli: "Aww..."

Bandit: "Okay, let's sort this out. What's the best move right now?"

The four contemplate on what to do next.

Bluey: "I know!"

My second day on the planet.

Look at all this. It's amazing!

And look at this little blue thing. Ohh.

And a red thing!

Hi. Agh!

(BOTH GIGGLE) It makes noises. Amazing.

Who are you calling 'It'?

We have names.

Oh, I'm sorry. I was born yesterday.

I don't know what a name is.

It's something you call something.

Like my name is Bluey. And mine's Bingo.

Blue-y.

Bin-go.

BOTH: Yes.

Can I have a name?

You've already got one. It's Bandit.

Ban-dit. I like it.

Oh, look at that.

This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

It's just a stool.

Hello, stool.

My name is Bandit.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) Stools can't talk!

Really? Why? They're not alive.

Alive? Yeah.

Alive?

No, that's not alive.

Oh! Uh, is it?

That's called food. You put it in your mouth.

Why would I put it in my... Ohh.

Oh, I feel like a new dog.

I like food. Thanks for the update.

And stools can't talk.

Kids, what have you done to your dad?

He was born yesterday.

He doesn't know anything.

Are you alive? Yoo-hoo!

Hi, I'm your wife.

My wife?

Yes, and if you want me to stay your wife,

you'll learn about dishwashers.

Dishwasher. Wife.

Wow. There's just so much to learn.

Whoa!

This is outside.

You've got some grass and some wood.

A fence. Argh! Look out!

BOTH: What is it?

There's a giant fireball in the big blue thing.

That's the sun. It's meant to be there.

And the big blue thing is the sky.

Oh. Phew.

This is a swing. Push me!

Swing.

No, the other way.

Oh, OK.

Swing.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) No!

This way.

Oh, swing.

This is... Oh! (BOTH GIGGLE)

So, this is our street.

You've got some cars and, ooh, a bird.

Ooh, rubbish.

Ooh! Don't worry about the sun.

It's meant to be there.

Uh, OK.

Ah, come on, Bandit. Huh?

Keep walking. I have a wife.

OK, Bandit, probably don't say things about the sun

to people at bus stops.

Yeah. Why?

It's hard to explain.

OK, I won't. Food!

(SINGS) Yeah, I got my steak and bacon.

Food! Oh, hey Bandit. Oi!

BOTH: Agh! Dad. No.

That's my pie! Get off it!

Drop! Gimme it.

Here! Food!

Oh, you ate all the sauce!

Sorry, Lucky's Dad. He was born yesterday.

Yeah, I'll say.

(GROANS) I can't hold him!

Run, Lucky's Dad. But I'm going that way.

Food! Just go!

Wah!

Oh. Bye, food. Ugh.

You can't just take people's food. Why?

'Cause it doesn't belong to you.

B-long?

Yeah, like everyone's stuff isn't everyone's, you know?

Everyone?

Look, just don't take people's food.

And don't talk about the sun, OK?

You have to just trust us. Why?

Well, because we've been on this planet longer than you.

That's true. I was only born yesterday.

G'day, Bandit.

I have nothing to say about the sun to you.

(BOTH GIGGLE) Er, great.

Wow. Name?

Oh, that's called a... Wait, Bingo.

It just makes trouble when we tell him what things are called.

Why don't we let him enjoy just looking at things today?

Yeah, we can teach him names later.

Name?

It doesn't matter. Just look.

Alive.

Hello, stool.

It's OK, Dad.

You can stop playing Born Yesterday.

Oh, you sure?

Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, real fun. Thanks.

No worries. I enjoyed it.

I feel like a new dog.

Bingo, can you help me unpack the dishwasher?

Sure.

Oh, good on you, kids.

Uh, kids? BOTH: Yeah?

Has your dad stopped playing Born Yesterday?

Yeah.

OK.

Just checking.

[Theme Song]

The epside begins in the backyard of the Heeler's family house. Bandit is hanging a fabric swing on a branch and Bluey is playing with a slap wrap.

Bingo: Make sure it's nice and high off the ground.

Bandit: Yes, boss.

Bluey snaps the wrap on Bandit's tail.

Bluey: Snap!

Bandit: Ow! Bluey! That's not making this any easier.

Judo peeks over the hedge.

Judo: What are you doing, Bluey's Dad?

Bluey: Hey, Judo.

Bandit: Just putting up a swing.

Bluey: Yeah, it's a fabric swing.

Bingo: Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school.

Judo: I know that. Bluey's my friend.

Bandit finishes putting up the swing.

Bandit: All right, have fun, squids. [He walks off the bench and takes the laundry basket.] I've gotta take the washing in.

Bluey excitingly jumps into the swing, giggling in the process.

Bluey: Let's play butterflies!

Bingo & Judo: Yeah!

[TITLE CARD]

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Butterflies.

The scene transitions to Bluey crawling like a caterpillar.

Bluey: Okay, first, the caterpillar crawls along the ground, [She gets in the swing] then it gets in the cocoon. [She then jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly] Then it hatches as a butterfly. But the butterfly catchers have been hiding and catch it.

Bingo: Ooh, can I be the caterpillar first?

Judo: I'm going first.

Bluey: Come on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey & Bingo run to hide behind the shed, while Judo lies down on the ground and begins crawling.

Bingo: Judo is so bossy.

Bluey: Yeah, she is, but she doesn't have anyone else to play with.

Bingo notices a ladybug walking on the wall of the shed.

Bingo: Ooh!

The scene cuts to a more detailed close-up of Bingo.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to blow his nose ♪

Bluey & Bingo stick out their tongues and blow hard making a farting noise. They both then laugh.

Bluey: She's coming out!

Judo jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly.

Bluey: Catch her!

Judo tries to run away, but Bluey & Bingo catch her. Bingo then lies down on the ground.

Bingo: My turn.

Judo: You're too small to be a caterpillar.

Bingo: No, I'm not!

Bluey: Go on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey then runs towards the shed. Judo gives Bingo an angry look before catching up with Bluey. After that, Bingo starts crawling. She then gets in the swing, struggling a bit in the process.

Judo: [Sigh] Little kids take so long to do everything!

Bluey: She's only got little legs.

Bingo finally gets inside the swing.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

The scene changes to Bluey and Judo standing behind the shed.

Bluey: Hurry up, Bingo.

Judo: Hey, Bluey.

Bluey: Yeah?

Judo: Let's run away from Bingo.

Bluey: What? Why?

Judo: She's taking ages!

Bluey: Well, uh... [She looks towards the swing.]

Judo: Come on!

Bluey: Wait for me!

Bingo finishes the song.

Bingo: Okay! I think I'm almost ready to be a butterfly now!

Bingo jumps out of the swing, again, waving her arms.

Bingo: Ooh! Look at me. I'm a butterfly!

Bingo: I'm flapping around. I hope there's no butterfly catchers nearby!

She takes a look behind the shed, only to find out Bluey & Judo are not there.

Bingo: Oh, where are they?

Bingo goes to looks for them both, still waving her arms. She walks by Bandit who is hanging laundry and still has the slap band on his tail. She then sees Bluey and Judo playing Pat-a-cake.

Bingo: Bluey! You were meant to catch me.

Judo: Aaaaah! Quick, Bluey, run away!

Judo then runs away. Meanwhile, Bluey is put in an uncomfortable situation and has to act fast. She turns around to follow Judo, while a look of regret appears on her face.

Bluey: Quick! We can hide in my house!

Bingo tears up and returns to the swing. Meanwhile, Bluey & Judo emerge from a bush.

Judo: I think we lost her.

Bluey: Uh, I might go and see if Bingo's all right.

Judo: She'll be fine. Now, let's play phones. [Judo types something on a imaginary phone.]

Bluey: Phones?

Judo: Ring, ring. Ring, ring!

Bluey: [Looking at her hands confused]I just think that Bingo might like-

Judo: [Interrupting] Ring, ring!!!

Bluey: Aaah! [Picks up the imaginary phone] Hello?

Judo: Hi. It's me, Judo. I've had such a nice day. Let me tell you all about it.

Bluey: Okay...

Judo: [Walking away] First, I bought some lovely new plants...

Bluey: Oh, is that right?

The scene cuts to Bingo sitting in the swing sad, singing the song. Then the scene cuts back to the front of Judo's house. Bluey is sitting on the lawn. She appears bored.

Judo: So, then I went to the bakery to get some cream buns for Casper, but they ran out of cream buns. Could you believe it?

Bluey: [Looking towards her house] Judo, I think I need to find Bingo.

Judo: So then I asked for chocolate éclairs...

Bluey: Judo-

Judo: ...but they were out of them, too! I mean, come on. I just don't know what the world's coming to.

Bluey: Okay, then. I'm going now. Bye. [Hangs up the imaginary phone.]

[Bluey gets up and quickly runs to her house.]

Bluey: Bingo! Bingo, where are you?

Bluey then runs past Bandit, who was still hanging the laundry. Bluey decides to look for her in the laundry basket, throwing out some of the laundry out.

Bandit: Hey!

Bluey then approaches the swing where Bingo sits.

Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean to run away from you. Well... she didn't make me do it. I did it a bit myself. I'll never do it again, Bingo. I promise. Please can we play together?

Upon not getting an answer from bingo, bluey tears up and sits down on the lawn next to the swing.

Bluey: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love her at all ♪

Bingo: ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bluey: [Turning around to Bingo] ♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

Bingo: [Sticking her head out of the swing] ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bingo then offers a hug to Bluey, which she accepts.

Judo: [Off-screen] Ring, ring!

Bluey: Oh, no! It's Judo on the phone! Tell her I'm not here!

Bingo: No! Quick, hide!

Judo walks by Bandit, who was picking up the laundry basket. As she walks by, she makes the "Ring, ring!" sound, which scares Bandit, causing him to drop the basket. Next she walks by the swing.

Judo: Ring, ring! Bluey! Where are you?

The scene changes to Bluey & Bingo hiding inside the swing.

Bingo: Put your phone on silent!

Bluey: Oh, yeah. Good idea. [Puts the phone on silent, vibrating her hand.] Thanks, Bingo.

Judo then suddenly peeks inside the swing, which scares both Bluey and Bingo.

Judo: There you are! You ran away from me.

Bingo: [Sticks her head out of the swing] Well, you ran away from me!

Bluey: [Also sticks her head out of the swing] And you were ignoring me.

Judo: Oh, yeah. I did...

Bluey: [Gets out of the swing] Okay, new rule. From now on, no one runs away from anyone, okay?

Judo: Okay.

Bingo: Okay.

Bluey: Sorry, Judo.

Judo: That's okay. I'm sorry, too, Bingo.

Bingo: That's okay. Just don't do it again.

The three girls then hug each other, giggling.

Bluey: All right, Bingo, you can be the butterfly.

Bingo: Actually, I wanna be the catcher.

Bluey: Me too.

Judo: Me too.

Bluey: Oh, but who will we catch, then?

Bandit: ♪ I'm gonna put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, I'm gonna --♪

His singing gets interrupted because the three girls jumped on him.

Script.jpg
The episode starts at the Gold Coast, where Chris's house is. The shot cuts inside Nana's house, where Bandit and Stripe have dropped off the kids Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, and Socks. Bluey is trying on her nana's glasses, Socks is playing with Nana's tail, and Muffin and Bingo are chasing after each other, orbiting around her. Bluey gives Nana her glasses back and joins the two.

Bandit: "Okay Mum, at least try and limit the amount of ice blocks to a reasonable number."

Nana: "Okay, got it!"

Stripe: "Right, let's go!"

Bandit: "See 'ya, kids! Be good to Nana!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Nana closes the door as the two exit. The pups stare at her.

The Pups: "Ice blocks!"

Nana: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts outside the apartment, with the pups enjoying their ice blocks and Muffin holding Socks so she can eat hers.

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, sweetie?"

Bluey: "Why do we get lots of ice blocks at your house, but hardly any when we're at our house?"

Nana: "Oh, well, that's a good question!"

Bingo: "Finished! Can we play charades now?"

Bluey & Muffin: "Yeah!"

Socks: "Woof!"

EPISODE TITLE: Charades

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Charades!"

The shot cuts to Nana's apartment, where the pups and Nana sit on the couch. Nana is sorting through the charade cards.

Muffin: "What's charades?"

Bluey: "It's easy, Muffin! First, you pick a card..."

Bingo: "But don't let anyone see it, okay?"

Muffin: "Okay!"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Bluey: "Then, you look at the picture on it!"

The card shows a picture of a duck.

Bluey: "Okay, got it."

Muffin: "What's on the card?"

Bingo: "No, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I need to see it!"

Muffin gets up and tries to pull the card box out of Nana's hands. Bluey and Bingo panic while Socks barks playfully.

Nana: "Oh- uh, no sweetie! We don't look at it! Bluey's going to act it out!"

Bingo: "And then we guess what it is!"

Muffin: "Ohhh!"

Bluey runs in front of the table.

Bluey: "Okay, ready?"

Bingo, Nana and Muffin: "Ready!"

Bluey proceeds to act out being a duck, walking in circles.

Muffin: "Uhhh, eagle!"

Nana: "Ohhh, it's a...bush turkey!"

Bingo: "Ibis!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bluey: "Nope!"

Nana: "Brolga!"

Bingo: "Chicken!"

Nana: "What about you, Socks?"

Socks whines, unable to guess.

Bingo: "Duck!"

The Pups: + Nana: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Good one, Bingo!"

Bingo: "Ooh, my turn!"

Muffin: "I want a turn!"

Bingo and Muffin fight over the card box. Nana stops Muffin as they try to pull it away from each other.

Nana: "Maybe just watch one more, sweetie!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Nana: "Go on, Bingo, pick a card!"

Bingo picks a ballerina card and squeals as she runs up. The shot shows us what the card is, and she sets it down after memorizing it.

Bingo: "Ooh, this is a good one! You ready?"

The Pups + Nana: "Ready!"

Bingo proceeds to act out being a ballerina.

Nana: "Uhhh...circle!"

Bluey: "Donut!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Nana: "The sun!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bingo: "Uh-uh!"

Muffin: "Chicken!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Bluey: "A dancer!"

Bingo: "Close!"

Nana: "Ooh, what do you think, Socks?"

Socks whines, again not being able to guess.

Muffin: "CHICKEN!"

Bluey: "I know! Ballerina!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

Nana: "Hooray!"

Muffin: "Good one, Bluey!"

Socks whines, saddened by being unable to play properly.

Nana: "Oh, never mind, Socks!"

Muffin: "It's my turn!"

Nana: "Okay, Muffin, your turn! Are you sure you know how to do it?"

Muffin runs up to the front, and Bingo goes to sit down.

Nana: "Pick a card! Okay now, take a look!"

Muffin looks down at her card. She gets a frog card.

Nana: "Now act it out!"

Muffin: "I don't want a frog card. I want the ballerina card!"

Nana: "Oh. Uhh...well..."

Bluey: "Muffin, you have to do the one on the card!"

Muffin: "BUT I WANT TO DO THE BALLERINA!"

Nana: "O-oh, okay! Bluey, why don't you look through the box for the ballerina card?"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey looks through the card box.

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Bluey: "...Hang on. Won't we know that Muffin is a ballerina?"

Nana: "Oh, y-yeah, but we'll play along for the littlies, okay?"

Bluey: "Oh, okay nana!"

Nana: "Almost there, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Bluey: "I can't find it!"

Muffin: "Keep looking!"

Bluey pulls a car card out.

Bluey: "What about a car?"

Bingo: "Ooh! Would you like to be a car, Muffin? You can do this!"

Bingo rolls on her back, attempting to emulate a car.

Muffin: "That's a squirrel!"

Nana: "Give me those cards, Bluey!"

Bluey: "That's not a car!"

Bingo: "Yeah it is!"

Bluey: "A car's like this!"

Bluey mimics movement of a steering wheel.

Bingo: "That's a steering wheel!"

Nana: "It must be in here somewhere..."

Muffin: "I don't want to be a car! I want to be a--"

Nana: "Ballerina!"

The Pups:' "Hooray!"

Nana: "There you go, Muffin!"

She gives Muffin the ballerina card.

Muffin: "Thanks, nana!"

Nana: "Okay, off 'ya go!"

Muffin stares at the card, an angry expression still plastered on her face.

Muffin: "I NEED A TUTU!"

The Pups groan in annoyance, and Nana thinking of a quick solution.

Nana: "O-oh, um...Bluey! Go and check Nana's dress-up box for a tutu!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Bingo run off to Nana's room.

Nana: "Quickly! She's going to blow her top!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo in Nana's dress-up room. They look around in the box on the ground.

Bluey: "Ooh. Confetti."

She rummages through the stuff.

Bluey: "Pirate...princess...-"

Bingo: "Tutu!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently, and Nana is petting Socks. Bluey and Bingo run in.

Bluey: "Here's the tutu, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Nana: "Oh, good one, girls!"

Bluey: "Put your legs through, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I'm trying!"

Bingo: "That's your arm!"

Bluey and Bingo help Muffin into her tutu.

Nana: "Push...Yeah, that's it!"

After some struggling they manage to get Muffin's tutu on.

Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Okay...off 'ya go!"

Muffin stands still for a brief moment, ready to act out a ballerina...

Muffin: "I need ballerina music!"

The Pups and Nana groan in annoyance.

Bluey & Bingo: "Muffin!"

Nana: "How about I sing you some?"

She starts singing, only for Muffin to get angered.

Muffin: "NO! IT NEEDS TO BE PROPER BALLERINA MUSIC!"

Bluey: "You don't need music, Muffin! You just need--"

Muffin: "I WANT MUSIC!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Nana: "O-oh, um...Oooh, I know! Bluey, Bingo, come with me!"

The shot cuts to Nana's bedroom, where she grabs a music box on the table.

Nana: "Did you know that I was given this music box by my nana?"

Bluey: "You mean you had a nana?"

Nana: "I did! A long time ago."

Bingo: "Hang on. We all know Muffin is going to be a ballerina."

Nana: "Well yes, I guess we do."

Bingo: "But that's not the proper rules!"

Nana: "You're right, Bingo. But that's what Muffin wants."

Bingo: "I don't understand!"

Nana: "Well, you know what? At Nana's house, I guess there's only one rule."

Bluey & Bingo: "What's that?"

Nana: "Everyone gets what they want!"

Bluey & Bingo: "Oh yeah!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently and Socks staring nervously at her. Bluey, Bingo and Nana enter!

Bluey: "We got the music!"

Nana: "Okay. You ready, Muffin?"

Muffin: "Ready!"

Nana: "You ready, Socks?"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Nana: "You ready, girls?"

Bluey & Bingo: "Ready, Nana!"

Nana: "Okay, let's go!"

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, Bluey?"

Bluey: "Was your nana a nice nana?"

Nana looks down at the music box, a sincere smile on her face.

Nana: "She was about the nicest nana you would ever wanna meet, Bluey."

Nana opens the music box, and begins winding it to create sound. With the music going and the room falling silent, Muffin begins dancing.

Bingo: "Hey Nana? When she's finished, should we pretend that we didn't know what she was?"

Nana: "Good idea, Bingo!"

Bluey: "Cause we have to take care of the littlies!"

Nana: "That's right!"

Muffin: "Shush!"

Nana smiles and continues playing the music box. Soon, the music comes to a close.

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Muffin!"

They throw confetti and Muffin smiles.

Muffin: "Can you guess what I was?"

Bluey, Bingo and Nana:' "Uhh...any idea? What was Muffin...?"

Socks: "Ballerina!"

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Socks!"

The episode pans out, showing the outside sunset as the pups laugh and Socks barking.

Lila: My name is Lila and this is my story (View outside of kindy) This is me on my first day at kindy. I was really shy. Mum says, that's OK, but that meant sometimes I wasn't really good at making friends. I just didn't know how to do it. But then one day that all changed. (The Heeler house) And it started with pet feet.

Bluey: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bingo: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bluey: Oh, you're extra stinky this morning.

This startles Bandit awake.

Bingo: Look at those big muscles! [while she is patting his muscles]

Bandit: [Lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast] Sorry Bingo. You slipped.

Chilli: [Waves goodbye to Bluey & Bingo] I'll see you in the morning, kids.

Bluey: [Runs to Chilli] I don't want you to go.

Chilli: [Rubs Bluey's Cheek] I know sweetie, but Mummy has to go to a baby shower tonight, okay?

[Bandit lets of of Bingo and grabs her fast again. Chilli gets in the car.]

Bandit: Oh! Again!

Bluey: Will I already be asleep when you get back?

Chilli: Yes, but I'll still come in and give you a kiss good night.

Bluey: But I won't feel it!

Chilli: Yes, you will.

Bingo: Who'll put us to bed?

Chilli: Your dad! It's a Daddy putdown.

Bingo: Hooray!

[Bluey lets out a sad yelp.]

Bandit: Don't worry, Bluey. I'm all over it.

He lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast yet again, this time Bingo almost hitting the ground.

Bandit: Whoa! That was a close one. No more of that game.

[Title card]

Bluey (voiceover): This episode of Bluey is called Daddy Putdown.

[The scene changes to the front of the house. Chilli honks the horn and drives off.]

Bandit & Bingo: Bye!

Bandit: Okay, kids, what should we do?

[Bluey takes out Bandit's phone.]

Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.

[Bandit takes the phone away.]

Bandit: We're not doing that.

Bluey: But I miss her!

Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?

Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to the dining room of the Heeler's house.]

Bandit: Right! I'm your Magnificent Leader, and you have to follow me. You kids got that?

Bluey & Bingo: Yes, Leader! [Both giggle]

Bandit: Now off to a better tomorrow!

[Bandit turns around and starts walking in a march-like fashion, with Bluey & Bingo following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪

♪ Something, something, united, we are strong ♪

[Both girls turn around and run into the living room and sit down on the couch. Bandit then walks in.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow-- ♪ Oh, hello, there! I- What?!

[Bluey & Bingo giggle]

Bandit: You were supposed to be following me!

[Bluey & Bingo laugh]

Bandit: Get back in line! [Both girls get off the couch and stand behind Bandit] Sitting around will not be tolerated!

[He starts walking in the march-like fashion with both girls following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪ Hmm. I'd best check on these followers to make sure they are indeed following me.

[He turns around, and Bluey & Bingo quickly get behind him.]

Bandit: Hey! What?

[He turns around multiple times, with both of the girls hiding behind him.]

Bandit: Hmph! Where are they?! Grrr! They've gone again!

[Bandit then looks for them in the house, but both girls still hide behind his back when he turns around. He then walks out of the house into the backyard.]

Bandit: There's that giggling again!

Bluey & Bingo: [whispering] One, two, three...

[They proceed to scare Bandit.]

Bandit: You little traitors!

[Bandit then starts chasing the girls. They run around in circles, before being caught by Bandit and falling down on the ground. Bluey & Bingo then giggle.]

Bingo: [Sits on Bandit's belly] Again!

Bandit: Oh, no, mate. The Magnificent Leader needs a break.

Bluey: I miss Mum! [She sits down on the lawn.]

Bandit: Maybe that game wasn't swingy enough. [Points to the swing.]

Bingo: [Gasps and gets off Bandit and runs up to the swing.] I know! Come Here and Go Away!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to Bandit pushing the swing with both girls sitting on it.]

Bandit: Okay, kids, come here.

[Bluey & Bingo swing to Bandit.]

Bandit: Now, the thing is-- [They swing away.] What?

[Both girls giggle.]

Bandit: Come here! [They swing back to Bandit.]

Bandit: Okay. So, as I was saying-- [They swing away again] What?!

[Both Girls giggle again]

Bandit: I said, come here! [They swing back to Bandit once again.]

Bandit: What? Aah! [They swing away yet again.]

Bluey: Now play Go Away!

Bandit: Okay. Go away! [He pushes the swing away.]

[Bluey & Bingo swing back to Bandit.]

Bluey: Hi!

Bandit: Huh? I said, go away! [He pushes the swing away as both girls start laughing.]

[They swing back to Bandit again.]

This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.

Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.

Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.

Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.

Bingo: Oops.

Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.

Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?

Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?

Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.

Bandit: SCAB!

Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.

Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?

Bandit: Ee!

Bluey: Dad ate it.

Bandit swallows guiltily.

Bingo: (betrayed) What?!

Crossing the Street/First Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Crossing.png
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.

Bingo: I was saving that chippy.

Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.

Bingo: I was still very hungry.

Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.

Bluey: Ah! I know.

Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.

Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!

Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode.

Bingo and Bluey giggle.

TITLE CARD - Dance Mode

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.

Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.

Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!

Bingo: Me too!

Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay.

The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.

Chilli: Green dog. Come on.

The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.

Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Bingo: Um, yes, okay.

Bluey: I'll do it.

Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.

Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! [to the drivers] She's not with us!

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it. Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.

Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!

Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.

Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!

Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.

Chilli: Phew.

Bluey: That was so funny.

Chilli is sweating a lot.

Bandit: You still got it, babe.

Chilli: You'll get yours.

Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.

Bluey: Okay.

Post Office/ Second Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Post-Office.png
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.

Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?

Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.

Bluey: Oh, yeah.

Bandit: Aw, what a shame.

Postie: Next, please.

Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.

Postie: How can I help?

Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.

Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.

Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.

Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.

Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.

Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?

Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --

Chilli: Pretty please.

Chilli makes her Please Face.

Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.

Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.

Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.

Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.

Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.

Bandit: Oh no!

Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.

Chilli: Dance mode!

Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.

Postie: Uh, are you okay?

Bandit does some kicks.

Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card

Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?

Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Bandit does The Running Man.

Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.

Bandit does a Cossack dance.

Bandit: I would if I could, mate.

Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.

Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!

Busker busking in the plaza
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.

Chilli: That was glorious.

Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?

Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.

Music starts to play.

Bluey: What's that noise?

Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;

Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!

Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.

Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.

Bandit: Nothing to see up there.

Bluey: Ooh, look!

Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing Dance Mode on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.

Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)

The Heelers approach.

Busker: Shake your tails!

Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!

Bingo: Wow!

Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?

Bingo: Ooh, yeah!

Bluey: Do it, Bingo.

Bingo: Dance mo--

Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.

Bandit: Oh, hang on.

Chilli: Yeah, hang on.

Bingo: Hey.

Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.

Bingo: Aw, what?

Bluey: No fair!

Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.

Dance-Mode-Bribe.png
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.

Chilli: Bandit, no!

Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!

Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.

Bluey makes her Please Face.

Bluey: Please, Bingo?

Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.

Bandit: Pretty please?

Bingo: Uh. Okay.

Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.

Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!

Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.

Bandit: Phew!

Chilli: This is not good parenting.

Yes/No Button Store
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.

Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.

Bluey: And if you push this one...

Dance-Mode-Shop.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey laughs.

Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?

Bingo: Uh, okay.

Bluey: Hooray!

The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.

Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.

Heeler's Car
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?

Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?

Bingo shakes her head.

Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?

Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."

Dance-Mode-Car-Talk.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?

Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: I thought so.

Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?

Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?

Bandit: This is confusing.

Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.

Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.

Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES

Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.

Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.

Chilli: Me too.

Bandit: Yeah, me too.

Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.

Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?

Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.

Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES

Back at the plaza
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.

Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!

The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.

Bluey: This is gonna be fun!

Bandit: Oh, boy.

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.

Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!

Bingo squeals and moves into position.

Bluey-Bandit-Chilli-Dancemode.png
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.

Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.

Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.

Bingo: Ready?

Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.

Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for my kid.

Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.

Bingo: Dance Moooode!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.

Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!

As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES

Busker: Whoo! Yeah!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.

Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!

Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.

Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!

[End credits]

Busker's song continues through the end credits.

[Bluey takes out Bandit's phone.]

Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.

[Bandit takes the phone away.]

Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?

Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!

[He starts walking in the march-like fashion with both girls following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪ Hmm. I'd best check on these followers to make sure they are indeed following me.

[He turns around, and Bluey & Bingo quickly get behind him.]

Bandit: Hey! What?

[He turns around multiple times, with both of the girls hiding behind him.]

Bandit: Hmph! Where are they?! Grrr! They've gone again!

[Bandit then looks for them in the house, but both girls still hide behind his back when he turns around. He then walks out of the house into the backyard.]

Bandit: There's that giggling again!

Bluey & Bingo: [whispering] One, two, three...

Bandit: Oh, no, mate. The Magnificent Leader needs a break.

Bluey: I miss Mum! [She sits down on the lawn.]

[Theme song]

The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo lying on the floor and drawing in the Heelers' playroom, which is a gigantic mess. There are toys all over the floor, the verandah, and even in the nearby shrubbery. Chilli walks in, holding a potted plant.

Chilli: Alright, kids, time to tidy up.

Bluey and Bingo: Aw, Mum!

Bluey: We don't like tidying.

Chilli: There's no way around it, I'm afraid.

The kids groan. As Chilli walks off, Bluey has an idea.

Bluey: Hey, Bingo. Let's get Daddy Robot to do it!

Bingo: Yeah!

Bluey and Bingo run off to find Daddy Robot.

TITLE CARD - a kids' couch with two socks on it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Daddy Robot!

In the kitchen, Bandit is munching on leftover takeaway in front of the fridge. Bluey and Bingo walk in.

Bluey: Hey, Daddy Robot!

Bandit quickly eats a few more spoons, before putting the container back in the fridge, shutting it, and beginning to act like a robot - which he does for the rest of the episode.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master. (beeps)

Bluey and Bingo giggle.

Bluey: We need you to do something. Come with us to the playroom.

Bluey and Bingo show the direction there.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master.

Suddenly, Bluey realises something.

Bluey: Wait. Actually, carry us to the playroom!

Bandit: Yes, Master.

Bandit mimics machine noises as he picks them both up.

Bingo: We have to robo-boogie there.

Bandit: (beeps) Yes, Master.

Bandit dances towards the playroom as the kids giggle. They reach the playroom, and Bandit stops.

Bluey: Daddy Robot, we order you to tidy up the playroom.

Bandit: (beeps) To serve my masters is the highest honour.

Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit begins cleaning the room.

Bluey: It's working!

Bluey and Bingo sit on a small couch in the room.

Bluey: Ahh!

Bingo: Ahh, so relaxing!

Bluey: Yeah, this is how we should always do it.

Bingo: Yeah.

Bluey: Actually, Daddy Robot, we never want to tidy the playroom ever again!

Bingo: Yeah. Ever again!

Bandit: Never again?

Bluey: Never again! Ever. At all. You understand?

Bandit: Yes, Master.

Bandit drops items in his hand, beeps, and shakes.

Bandit: Recalculating objectives.

Bandit walks behind the kids' couch and lifts it, shanking it as he does.

Bluey and Bingo: Aah! What are you doing, Daddy Robo-o-ot?

Bandit: Following Master's orders. (beeps)

Bluey: Aah! Put us down!

Bingo: (giggles) I love Daddy Robot!

Bandit exits the room, carrying the couch. through the hallway.

Bluey: Where are you taking us?!

Bandit: (beeps) To the wheelie bin.

Bluey: What?! Why?!

Bandit: You two are the reason playroom is always untidy. If I throw you in wheely bin, playroom will always be tidy. And then you will never have to tidy playroom ever again.

Bluey and Bingo: What?!

Bandit: It's a solid plan, Master.

Bluey and Bingo scream in horror as they're carried to the living room, where Chilli is spraying her plant.

Bluey: Mum! Daddy Robot is going to throw us in the wheelie bin!

Chilli: Oh no!

Bluey: Quick, Mum, we need the sprayer!

Chilli: Catch!

Chilli throws the sprayer, which Bluey catches and uses to spray Bandit, making him malfunction and act in strange ways.

Bandit: (various beeps) Syntax error. (buzzes) Please press "play" on tape. (more beeps)

Chilli: He's malfunctioning!

Bandit beeps, then begins to beatbox and dance.

Chilli: Why was Daddy Robot throwing you in the wheely bin?!

Bluey: Oh, um... well...

Bandit: Must tidy up. (beeps and boops) Come here, vacuum cleaner.

Bandit picks up Bluey and uses her as a vacuum cleaner.

Bluey: Aaah! I'm not a vacuum cleaner!

Bingo: Yeah, Daddy Robot! She's not a vacuum cleaner!

Bandit holds Bluey upside-down.

Bandit: Oh yes. (beeps) My mistake. This is not a vacuum cleaner.

Bluey: I told you!

Bandit: It's a banjo.

Bluey: What?!

Bandit begins to play Bluey like a banjo, vocalising banjo sounds as Bluey laughs from being tickled.

Bingo: Hey, that's my sister! Not a banjo!

Bandit puts Bluey down and points to Bingo.

Bandit: (beeps) What are you doing out of the laundry basket?

Bingo: Laundry basket?!

Bandit: Yes. You are laundry. I folded you this morning. Come here.

Bingo screams as she tries to run away. Bandit picks her up as she giggles and brings her to the laundry room. He places her in the basket and folds her limbs.

Bandit: Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold!

Bingo: (giggles) I'm not laundry!

Bluey runs in.

Bluey: She's not laundry!

Bandit turns to Bluey.

Bandit: Oh no. A guinea pig has escaped.

Bluey: What?!

Back in the living room, Chilli is spraying another plant when Bluey runs in, screaming in terror.

Bluey: Mum, Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig! What should I do?!

Bandit enters, squat dancing after Bluey.

Bandit: Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Come back here, guinea pig.

Chilli: You have to push his nose to turn him off!

Bingo runs in with a laundry basket and hides under it.

Bingo: But how?!

Bluey: I know, I've got an idea!

Bandit enters the sunroom, dancing with style. Bluey follows.

Bluey: Look, Daddy Robot!

Bandit buzzes and Chilli enters the room, acting as "Mummy Robot".

Bluey: It's a Mummy Robot!

Chilli: (beeps) Hello.

Bandit: (beeps) Cheese and crackers, you're the most beautiful robot I've ever seen!

Chilli: (beeps) You are too kind.

Bandit: My name is Daddy Rob-

Bandit suddenly breaks into an Irish stepdance, complete with music. Then he and the music suddenly stop. Crickets.

Chilli: That was a little odd.

Meanwhile, Bluey and Bingo get prepared on a couch behind their parents.

Bandit: Please pretend I didn't just do that.

Chilli: It is hard to unsee something like that.

Bandit: Even so...

Suddenly, Bluey and Bingo jump on Bandit and pin him to the ground.

Bandit: Off me, furry creatures!

Chilli stops acting like Mummy Robot.

Chilli: Alright now, turn him off!

Bluey: Touch his nose, touch his nose!

Bluey manages touch Bandit's nose, making him freeze and power down.

Bandit: Powering down...

Chilli gasps and hurries to Bandit's side.

Bandit: Cursed... to depart... having only just... known... your beauty...

Chilli: Aw...

Bandit makes one last whirr before finally shutting down. The kids look at him sadly.

Bingo: Poor Daddy Robot.

A brief silence. Suddenly, Bandit lets loose a huge fart, much to Chilli's disgust and the kids' amusement. Cut to inside the playroom, where Chilli is repairing Bandit in a makeshift workshop lit with a table lamp.

Chilli: Screwdriver.

Bingo hands her a crayon.

Bingo: Screwdriver. Please fix him.

Chilli uses the "screwdriver" on Daddy Robot, tickling him as she does.

Chilli: I'll try my best. These circuits are badly damaged.

Bingo: Aww...

Chilli: It's strange, though. Daddy Robots don't usually go crazy like that.

Bluey: Well, actually, it's our fault.

Bingo: We ordered Daddy Robot to tidy the playroom for us.

Chilli: And that's when he tried to throw you in the wheelie bin?

Bingo: Yeah.

Chilli: Oh. I see. Okay. I'll tell you the secret. Daddy Robots will find the easiest way to do a job.

Bluey and Bingo: Oh.

Chilli: Just... like... kids!

Chilli tickles Bingo. Cut to black, where Bingo can be heard, echoing.

Bingo: I hope he's ok.

The black turns out to be the first-person view from Bandit, who powers up and opens his eyes to see Bluey and Bingo.

Bluey: Hello, Daddy Robot!

Bingo: How are you feeling?

Bandit: (beeps) I dreamt... I met... a robot angel. (buzzes) Hello, Master. What are my orders? (beeps)

Bluey: Follow us.

Back with the playroom mess, Bluey guides a beeping Bandit to two small couches.

Bluey: Now sit down.

Bandit sits on one of the couches.

Bandit: Yes, Master?

Bingo: Now lie back.

Bandit lies back in the couch.

Bandit: (buzzes) Are you sure, master?

Bandit gets up.

Bandit: (buzzes) Shouldn't I tidy something up for you?

Bluey pushes Daddy Robot back.

Bluey and Bingo: No.

Bluey: We order you to relax, Daddy Robot.

Bandit sits back down on the couch and happily gets relaxed. Bingo giggles and runs off.

Bandit: I've never relaxed before. Is this right?

Bluey: Usually, you close your eyes.

Bandit closes his eyes. Bluey turns back and beckons.

Bluey: Look who's here!

Bingo returns with Chilli, who is once again acting as Mummy Robot.

Chilli: (beeps) Hello again.

Upon hearing her, Bandit wakes up, surprised. Chilli beeps and does a pose.

Bandit: Cheese and crackers...

Chilli beeps and buzzes as she makes her way to the other couch and sits on it.

Bingo: You robots relax. We're gonna tidy the playroom.

Bluey: Come on, Bingo!

Bluey and Bingo: Bye, robots!

As Bluey and Bingo pick up their toys, Bandit and Chilli watch the sunset.

Bandit: This... feels like... a robo-dream.

Chilli: Well, kiss me before you wake up.

Bandit and Chilli share a kiss with the setting sun as a background and soaring electronic music. Cut to Bluey and Bingo watching, the music dropping out.

Bluey and Bingo [like schoolkids]: Oooooh!

[End credits]

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a happy electronic piece.

This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.

Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.

Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.

Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.

Bingo: Oops.

Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.

Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?

Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?

Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.

Bandit: SCAB!

Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.

Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?

Bandit: Ee!

Bluey: Dad ate it.

Bandit swallows guiltily.

Bingo: (betrayed) What?!

Crossing the Street/First Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Crossing.png
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.

Bingo: I was saving that chippy.

Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.

Bingo: I was still very hungry.

Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.

Bluey: Ah! I know.

Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.

Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!

Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode.

Bingo and Bluey giggle.

TITLE CARD - Dance Mode

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.

Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.

Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!

Bingo: Me too!

Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay.

The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.

Chilli: Green dog. Come on.

The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.

Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Bingo: Um, yes, okay.

Bluey: I'll do it.

Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.

Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! [to the drivers] She's not with us!

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it. Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.

Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!

Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.

Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!

Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.

Chilli: Phew.

Bluey: That was so funny.

Chilli is sweating a lot.

Bandit: You still got it, babe.

Chilli: You'll get yours.

Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.

Bluey: Okay.

Post Office/ Second Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Post-Office.png
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.

Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?

Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.

Bluey: Oh, yeah.

Bandit: Aw, what a shame.

Postie: Next, please.

Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.

Postie: How can I help?

Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.

Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.

Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.

Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.

Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.

Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?

Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --

Chilli: Pretty please.

Chilli makes her Please Face.

Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.

Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.

Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.

Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.

Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.

Bandit: Oh no!

Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.

Chilli: Dance mode!

Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.

Postie: Uh, are you okay?

Bandit does some kicks.

Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card

Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?

Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Bandit does The Running Man.

Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.

Bandit does a Cossack dance.

Bandit: I would if I could, mate.

Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.

Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!

Busker busking in the plaza
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.

Chilli: That was glorious.

Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?

Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.

Music starts to play.

Bluey: What's that noise?

Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;

Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!

Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.

Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.

Bandit: Nothing to see up there.

Bluey: Ooh, look!

Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing Dance Mode on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.

Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)

The Heelers approach.

Busker: Shake your tails!

Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!

Bingo: Wow!

Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?

Bingo: Ooh, yeah!

Bluey: Do it, Bingo.

Bingo: Dance mo--

Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.

Bandit: Oh, hang on.

Chilli: Yeah, hang on.

Bingo: Hey.

Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.

Bingo: Aw, what?

Bluey: No fair!

Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.

Dance-Mode-Bribe.png
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.

Chilli: Bandit, no!

Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!

Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.

Bluey makes her Please Face.

Bluey: Please, Bingo?

Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.

Bandit: Pretty please?

Bingo: Uh. Okay.

Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.

Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!

Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.

Bandit: Phew!

Chilli: This is not good parenting.

Yes/No Button Store
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.

Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.

Bluey: And if you push this one...

Dance-Mode-Shop.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey laughs.

Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?

Bingo: Uh, okay.

Bluey: Hooray!

The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.

Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.

Heeler's Car
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?

Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?

Bingo shakes her head.

Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?

Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."

Dance-Mode-Car-Talk.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?

Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: I thought so.

Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?

Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?

Bandit: This is confusing.

Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.

Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.

Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES

Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.

Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.

Chilli: Me too.

Bandit: Yeah, me too.

Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.

Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?

Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.

Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES

Back at the plaza
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.

Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!

The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.

Bluey: This is gonna be fun!

Bandit: Oh, boy.

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.

Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!

Bingo squeals and moves into position.

Bluey-Bandit-Chilli-Dancemode.png
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.

Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.

Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.

Bingo: Ready?

Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.

Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for my kid.

Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.

Bingo: Dance Moooode!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.

Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!

As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES

Busker: Whoo! Yeah!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.

Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!

Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.

Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!

[End credits]

Busker's song continues through the end credits.

The episode starts at the Heeler household, in the late evening.

Bandit: "Big sleep tonight, kids! The easter bunny's coming!"

Chilli: "I wonder how many eggs he'll leave you in your easter pouches!"

Bingo: "How do we know he won't forget us again?"

Bluey: "Yeah, like he did last year!"

Chilli: "Look, we've been through this. He didn't forget you! He was just late. He explained it all in his letter, remember?"

The shot moves to Bandit, who reads a note left on the wall from last Easter.

Bandit: "Dear Bluey and Bingo, so sorry I was late with your easter eggs. I had some family stuff on. I won't go into it. Big love, easter bunny. See? He was just busy!"

The Pups: "Okay."

Chilli: "We promise he won't forget this time."

Bandit and Chilli exit. Before she does however, she knocks over a bottle of confetti.

Chilli: "Oh goodness!"

Bandit: "Eh, we'll clean it up in the morning."

Chilli: "Night kids!"

Chilli and Bandit leave.

Bingo: "Bluey!"

Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo?"

Bingo: "Why did the easter bunny only forget us?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

Bingo: "Do you think he'll remember us this time?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I do! Night, Bingo."

Bluey goes to sleep and Bingo stares up at the ceiling.

EPISODE TITLE: Easter

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Easter."

The shot cuts to Bluey waking up in the morning. She suddenly sits up.

Bluey: "It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!"

Bingo is startled and falls out of bed.

Bingo: "Did he come!?"

Bluey checks her easter pouch on her bed.

Bluey: "I'm not sure. I can't see any eggs!"

Bingo goes to check hers as well.

Bingo: "Mine's empty too! He forgot us again!"

Bluey: "Wait!"

Bingo: "What is it?"

Bingo runs over to Bluey, who pulls out a rainbow box out of her easter pouch, the only item in there.

Bluey: "It's a box!"

Bingo: "Eeee, the egg must be inside!"

Bluey opens the box and turns it over, only to find it empty.

Bluey: "It's empty!"

Bingo: "Awwww...."

Bluey: "Let's check yours again!"

Bluey & Bingo run over to the latter's bed, as Bingo reaches into her easter pouch and pulls out the letter B.

Bingo: "There is something! Oh, it's just a buh. He doesn't care about us!"

Discouraged, Bingo sits down with a saddened expression.

Bluey: "He does, Bingo! I think these are clues to where he's hidden our easter eggs!"

Bluey examines the items and tries to think of what it could mean.

Bluey: "Ooh, I know! Letter, box!

The Pups: "Letterbox!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo, who are speeding down the hallways with the easter pouches strapped to their backs. They run down the stairs and outside to the letterbox.

Bingo: "Are the eggs in there?"

Bluey: "No, just a chatterbox."

Bingo: "Is it from the easter bunny!?"

Bluey: "It is! Look!"

Bingo squeals and Bluey tries solving it.

Bluey: "Easter...egg! Hmmm...what's your favorite color?"

Bingo: "Blue, like you!"

Bluey lifts up the blue colored flap on the chatterbox, and shows a picture of the easter egg and a chef hat.

Bluey: "It's a cook's hat, with an egg!"

Bingo: "What does it mean?"

Bluey: "Well, cooks work in the kitchen...maybe the easter eggs are in the kitchen!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

The two laugh and run back inside the house.

Bingo: "The easter bunny knows my favorite color!"

Bluey: "I told you he cares about you!"

The pups run into the kitchen, where Bandit and Chilli are.

Bandit: "Happy Easter-- hey!"

Chilli: "Hey!"

Bluey and Bingo scramble to find the easter eggs, pushing Bandit and Chilli out of the way.

Bluey: "Sorry mum, we're looking for the easter eggs! They could be anywhere..."

Bingo: "Bluey look, it's an egg!"

Bingo points at the front of the refrigerator, where various fridge magnets and letters are shaped to form an easter egg.

The Pups: "Whoa..."

Bingo opens the fridge, and Bluey squeals excitedly, believing their hunt to be over. However, they find nothing.

Bluey: "Ah, they're not in here."

Bingo: "Awww..."

Bluey: "Wait, look at the normal eggs!"

Bingo: "Oh? The Easter Bunny doesn't bring normal eggs. He brings chocolate eggs!"

Bluey: "I know, but look at the end one!"

The camera zooms in on the "egg" that stands out from the rest, at the end of the carton.

Bingo: "Huh? One egg is a kiwi! Maybe there's chocolate inside!"

The shot cuts to Bandit, as Bluey and Bingo run to him.

Bluey: "Dad, is there chocolate in this?"

Bandit: "Let's see!"

Bluey gives Bandit the kiwi, who promptly cuts in half. However, its only a normal kiwi.

Bandit: "No, no chocolate."

Bingo: "Aww..."

Bluey thinks hard on what it could mean, being a potential clue for the easter eggs' true location.

Bluey: "I think I know where the eggs are!"

The pups run to the living room, where the kiwi rug resides.

Bluey: "The kiwi rug!"

Bingo: "I'll look under it!"

Bluey: "Hmm...I can't see them."

Bingo: "Aww...Maybe the easter bunny just likes other children more than me."

Bluey: "No, Bingo, he likes you! It's just that..-"

Bingo: "Ah, look!"

Bingo points to the kiwi rug, where they spot an arrow.

Bluey: "It's an arrow!"

Bingo: "It's pointing to the backyard!"

Bluey: "Come on!"

The pups run outside into the backyard, where they split up to find it.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo checks the sand castle, and Bluey runs to examine another area.

Bingo: "I don't remember that sand castle."

Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Are the poinsettia flowers normally in a straight line?

Bingo: "Hmm...Usually they're more higgledy piggledy."

Bluey: "I think it's a picture."

Bingo: "A picture of what?"

Bluey: "I don't know! But I know how to find out, come on!"

The pups run up the stairs onto the top of the second floor deck. They go to check the poinsettia petals.

Bluey: "Wow."

Bingo: "It's a castle! Our eggs must be in the castle!"

Bluey: "There's a castle in London! We've gotta get to the airport!"

Bingo: "No, Bluey! I think it's a different castle!"

The shot cuts back to the sand castle in the backyard.

Bingo: "I think it's this one!"

Bluey bashes straight into the castle, destroying it. Afterwards, she begins digging a hole into the sand, squealing in excitement.

Bluey: "I hit something!"

Bingo: "Is it chocolate!?"

Bluey: "It is, it is!"

Bingo squeals. Have they finally found the easter eggs?

Bluey: "Wait...it isn't. It's toilet paper."

Bingo: "Awww!"

Bluey: "Hang on, look! Eggs! It's another clue! Come on!"

Bluey runs off, with Bingo following. She falls into the hole Bluey dug, and giggles. The shot cuts to the bathroom, where they begin looking again.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo: "There's no eggs in here!"

Bluey: "There must be! Toilet paper belongs in the toilet! Unless...Oh, no!"

Bingo: "What?"

Bluey: "They might be in Dad's toilet!"

The pups gasp, with the camera zooming in on their fearful faces. The shot then cuts to Bandit on the toilet. Bluey and Bingo peek in.

Bandit: "Ugh...Bandit!"

Bluey: "Augh, it stinks!"

Bingo: "How are we gonna find the next clue?"

Bluey: "Someone has to go in there!"

Bingo: "But it stinks so much we'll die!"

Bluey: "I know!"

Bingo: "Aww...there will be no Easter."

Bluey: "Yes there will be, Bingo. I'm going in!"

Bluey enters the bathroom, holding her breath.

Bluey: "Ugh, it stinks. I can't...do it..."

She falls to the ground, before she suddenly pops back up.

Bluey: "Wait!"

She looks at the mirror, where a drawing of Bluey and Bingo's bedroom window is present. The shot then cuts back to Bluey exiting the bathroom, coughing and catching a breath of fresh air.

Bingo: "Did you find it?"

Bluey gives Bingo a small note with a drawing of the window.

Bingo: "Oh, I know what this is!"

The shot cuts to the pups running into their bedroom. Bingo runs up to the window and holds the note over it.

Bingo: "It's our window! They must be in here!"

Bluey: "But we've already looked here! I don't understand!"

Bingo: "I do. He forgot us again."

Bingo sits down, discouraged. Bluey accepts defeat and sits down with her.

Bluey: "Maybe you're right, Bingo."

Bingo: "It's my fault, Bluey. I'm just a small, forgettable child."

Bluey: "No you're not, Bingo! You're a great child!"

Bingo: "Really?"

Bluey: "Yes, you're smart! You figured out the castle clue all by yourself!"

Bingo: "Yeah, I did!"

Bluey: "It's me who's forgettable."

Bingo: "You are not! You're brave! You went into Dad's stinky toilet!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, I did!"

Bluey stands back up.

Bluey: "We're not forgettable!"

Bingo: "Yeah, we're rememberable!

The pups hug each other.

Bingo: "Happy easter, Bluey."

Bluey: "Happy easter, Bing-oooh! Look!"

Bluey points to the easter decorations on the carpet. They're formed to resemble footprints.

Bingo: "Footprints! Bunny footprints!"

The Pups: "Easter Bunny footprints!"

The two squeal excitedly, running to follow the path. The path leads them to Bandit's workroom, where a lamp is set up right above the yoga ball. As Bluey moves the ball aside, they have finally found the easter basket, full of chocolates and other goodies.

Bingo: "He remembered us!"

END CREDITS

The episode starts with a distant view of the Heeler car on the highway, before cutting to the front of the car with Chilli driving the kids off to Nanas.

Bingo: "Where are we going?"

Chilli: "We're dropping you kids at Nana's remember?"

Bluey and Bingo: "Hooray! TV!"

Bandit: "No TV."

Bluey: "But why not?"

Bandit: "Cause you've been watching it all morning!"

Bluey: "But what are we meant to do?"

Bandit: "I don't know, use your imagination and draw some pictures."

Bluey: "I don't know what to draw?"

Chilli: "Oh nonsense."

Bluey: "Don't worry Bingo, Nana will let us watch TV!"

Chilli: "I heard that."

Bluey: "Hey hang on, why aren't you coming to Nanas?"

Chilli: "Because you and your dad want to spend some time together!"

Bluey: "What?! Without us?"

Bandit: "Yeah, hard to believe isn't it?"

Bluey: "What are you gonna do?"

Bandit: "Well were gonna lie in comfy hammocks wearing sunglasses!"

From this point, it will switch through drawings and back in the car within this point.

Chilli: "Drinking from coconuts with those little umbrellas."

Bandit: "With no kids allowed."

A sign pops down with both the kids face in drawings with little X signs on them.

Chilli: "Yea, no kids allowed!"

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

TITLE SCREEN: Escape

Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called "Escape"!"

TITLE SCREEN END

Bingo: "This is outrageous!"

Bluey: "Yea we're gonna come and join in! You can't stop us!"

Chilli: "Oh no, here come the kids!"

Bingo and Bluey: "Yaahh!"

Bandit: "Well a huge wall pops up, and its ten hundred meters tall!"

Chilli: "Nice one, Dad."

Bluey: "A wall? Why?"

Bandit: "I told you, no kids allowed!"

Bluey: "Well, we hire an eagle to fly us up over the wall!"

Bingo giggles.

Bandit: "Aww, what?"

Chilli: "Well, on the other side of the wall with a huge prickle bush with big prickles!"

Bandit: "Oh, good thinking!"

Chilli: "And, you can't pay the eagle again because you ran out of money! And anyway, he's on the toilet!"

Bingo: "Well then, I brought a lawnmower with me and I'm gonna mow the prickle bush down! Mooowwww!"

Bandit: "Oh no!"

Bluey: "Good one Bingo!"

Chilli: "Well, we go down this secret tunnel to our underground beds."

Bandit: "Which also has hammocks."

Bluey: "Well we go down the tunnel too!"

Chilli: "You can't, there's a manhole cover, which is locked."

Bluey: "Well I get an axe and chop a hole in it!"

Chilli: "It's made of metal, your axe breaks."

Bluey: "Hmm what chops through metal?"

Bandit: "Uh, diamond?"

Chilli: "Bandit don't help them!"

Bandit: "Sorry!"

Bluey: "Hehe! We use a diamond axe and chop through it!"

Bingo: "Hurray!"

Bandit: "Aww no!"

Chilli: "Quick! Time to bail! We get in a car."

Bandit: "Yea, but a cool car. Let's go let's go let's go!"

Bingo: "Bluey let's get in the dream house car!"

Bluey: "Ohh yeahh."

Bandit: "The what?"

Bluey: "The dreamhouse car. It's like a giant dream house on wheels!"

Bingo: "Yeah and it's got 11 burger shops.. and 20 bedrooms, and 40 toilets.. and a spa on the balcony!"

Bandit: "Who's driving it?"

Bluey: "Butlers."

Bandit: "Butlers?! Oh no, punch it mum!"

Chilli: "Punching it!"

Bluey: "Faster butlers!"

Intense car pursuit.

Bandit: "C'mon their gaining!"

Chilli: "I can't go any faster!"

The pursuit continues.

Bluey: "Hi."

Chilli screams.

Bandit: "Right that's it, we drive into the airport, get in the helicopter and we fly off!"

Chilli: "See ya later!"

Bluey: "Well.. we push a button which makes the wheels on the dream house turn into rockets so we fly into the air!"

Motorcyclist Butlers fall down to the ground screaming

Chilli: "Who made this thing?"

Bluey: "Jerry Lee, he's our science butler."

Jerry Lee presses a button that causes a plunger to shoot out to the current pursuing helicopter to stick to them to catch up.

Chilli: "Aah! Dad, get out of here!"

Bandit: "I'm trying! I just need to learn how to fly this thing."

The girls giggle.

Chilli: "That's it, we're punching out!"

Bluey: "Oh so do we! But.. we have special parachutes that still have the spa attached to them. And Jerry Lee is there fanning us."

The girls laugh.

Chilli: "I'm unsure how Jerry Lee earns his money."

Bandit: "Well we leg it!"

Bingo: "We throw cupcakes at you!"

Chilli: "Oh good! I eat them."

Bandit: "And we're getting away!"

Bluey: "But... you run into a big cliff that is that is a million million miles high!"

Bandit: "We're trapped!"

Bluey and Bingos mini spa parachute lands.

Bluey and Bingo: "Thanks Jerry Lee!"

Bluey: "Aha! You've got nowhere to run now! Hehe.."

Chilli: "Ok, you win. We give up, you caught us."

Bluey: "Uh, no. You have to keep trying to get away."

Bandit: "What?

Chilli: "But you caught us. We'll play with you."

Bingo: "No um, we like it when you run away from us

Bandit: "Aw don't be silly give us a hug."

Bluey and Bingo: "Noooo!"

Bluey: "Run Bingo!"

Bandit: "Quick! They're getting away!"

Bluey: "We run as fast as we can!"

Chilli: "We're chasing you!"

Bingo: "We jump on our scooter that's electricity!"

Chilli: "Well we get on our scooter that's electricity, but we've paid Jerry Lee to pull us on a motorbike too!"

Bluey: "Argh Jerry Lee you work for us!"

Bandit: "Yea but not anymore! We gave him our coconut drinks so he likes us better now!"

Bingo: "We scoot to the place where rockets take off and we jump in one, and take off to space."

Chilli: "Yea but we jump onto the tail."

Bandit knocks on the rocket window.

Bandit: "We just want to loove you!"

The kids giggle.

Bingo: "Well we go up to space!"

Bluey: "Yeah where there is no air!"

Chilli: "Dad quick! Take a big breath!"

Bluey: They can't hold it forever.

The parents inhale and hold their breath, with it switching from drawing and back to the car a few times, and then exhaling, and proceeding to let go and fall back.

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Chilli: "Aww you got away!"

Bluey and Bingo: "Hooray! We win!"

Bingo: "We're gonna live on the moon!"

Chilli: Well done.

Both giggling, when at that point they pull up to Nanas.

Bandit: "We're here!"

Nana: "Hi girls!"

It cuts to Nanas apartment.

Chilli: "Have fun with Nana!"

Bluey and Bingo: "We will!"

Bandit: "Thanks mum."

Nana: "You two make the most of it. It's not easily getting time to yourselves."

Chilli: "It certainly isn't. See ya kids."

Bluey and Bingo: See ya!

The parents leave as Nana closes the door.

Bingo: "Nana can we watch TV?"

Nana: "Well ok. If that's what you want!"

Bingo giggles.

Bluey: "No Bingo let's draw!"

Bingo: "Oh ok."

Nana: "Oh, well ok. I'll get the pens and paper."

It cuts to them drawing with Nana on the couch watching them.

Nana: "Ooh. And what's this one, Bingo?"

Bingo: "It's the dream house car, that's what we chased Mum and Dad in."

Nana: "Oh, the dream house car."

Bingo: "That's the spa, see? It has a little dome in it. Hehehe."

Nana: "Oh it does too."

Bluey: "And this is Jerry Lee."

Nana: "Oh, Jerry Lee parachuting, got it."

Bluey: "He's is one of our butlers."

Bingo: "And this is us on the moon!"

Nana: "Oh goodness you kids got good imaginations."

Bluey and Bingo: "Yes Nana."

Nana: "I don't know where you get your ideas from."

The shot goes up with both Bandit and Chilli on the hammocks with coconut drinks with the little umbrellas with it.

The credits roll, it shows Bingo and Bluey in drawing form, dancing around with the OST playing while the entire drawing chasing scene.

Muffin: Ahh!

Stripe: Ugh! I can handle it.

Trixie: Uhh, are you sure?

Stripe: Yeah, I got it covered. Kids, you better share that thing or I'm switching it off!

Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: What?!

Stripe: Woah! Ok, maybe not off. But…

Trixie: Look, I'll handle it.

Stripe: No, I can handle it! You do your thing.

Trixie: Well, okay... if you're sure.

Stripe: Now you have a good think about it, young lady!

Muffin: No! I don't want to!

Stripe: (Pops head in) I'm sorry girls, but Muffin was hogging, so she can't do your Faceycall thing anymore.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay, Uncle Stripe!

Stripe: She needs to learn that other people have- What the?

Muffin: Yes, I can! Now where do I hide?

Bingo: Under a bed!

Muffin: Okay!

Bluey: Don’t help her, Bingo!

Bingo: Why not?

Bluey: Cause she’s not meant to be running away, she’s meant to be in time out for hogging. Hey, that’s my ukulele!

Muffin: You lended it to me!

Bluey: Yeah, but that was ages ago!

Muffin: I’m still playing with it!

Stripe: (Pops head in on Sock's screen) Muffin, you hang that phone up now, young lady!

Muffin: No!

Stripe: Okay, well, I’m ending the whole FaceyTalk!

Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: No!

Stripe: Okay! Okay! Muffin, this is your last chance; you hang that up and march down here now!

Muffin changes Stripe’s face to a gorilla on the FaceyTalk

Muffin: Gorilla man!

Bluey and Bingo: laugh

Stripe: What? What did you- Get this thing off me! That’s it! Where are you? Oh, okay, you’re under a bed. Can’t see whose. Well, there are only so many beds in this house, kid. I’m coming!

Bingo: Oh, no!

Bluey: He’s gonna find you, Muffin!

Bingo: Just give him back his phone.

Muffin: No! Tell me if he’s out there.

Muffin positions the camera in view of the hallway

Bluey: It’s clear, but, Muffin, I don’t think I should help you.

Muffin: What about now?

Muffin positions the camera to show Stripe looking for her under a couch

Bluey and Bingo: Ahh! Not clear! Not clear!

Stripe: Aha! Got you!

Muffin screams and it irritates Stripe, Bluey, Bingo and Socks while running away.

Bandit: (Walks in) Good gravy! What’s going on?

Bandit: (laughs) Classic Stripe.

Stripe is chasing Muffin down a hallway while she’s screaming

Stripe: Get back here, Muffin!

Bandit: Uh, guys?

Stripe: She escaped from time out!

Trixie: We don’t do time out anymore!

Stripe: What? Since when?

Trixie: I read a blog!

Stripe: You didn’t tell me!

Trixie: Cause you’re never here!

Bandit: Hey, uh, guys?

Trixie: Just let me handle it, Stripe.

Stripe: No, Trix, let me handle it. I get to parent too!

Trixie: Yeah, but…you have to do it right.

Stripe: This is how I do it.

Bandit: Guys? Kids, can you switch this off?

Bluey: Ahh! But we’re doing drawing things!

Bandit: Alright, well, can you mute it?

Bluey: Yeah, we can.

Stripe: I feel like…you hog all the parenting.

Trixie: Oh…

Bandit: Is it this one?

Trixie: I don’t mean to.

Bluey: No, try this one.

Trixie: If you say one thing and I say another…

Bandit: Uh, no, that’s not it.

Trixie: …the kids get confused.

Bingo: Oh! I know!

The FaceyTalk is muted

Bandit: You can turn the sound back on once Stripe and Trix have finished chatting. Okay?

Bluey and Bingo: Yes, dad.

The scene shows Stripe and Trix talking (on mute) and later making up with a handshake and hug eachother.

Bluey: Uh, Muffin.. Better look behind you.

Muffin: Why?!

The scene later shows both Trixie and Stripe chasing after a screaming Muffin

Bingo: Stop running away, Muffin!

Bluey: Stop it!

Stripe: Muffin, I would urgently advise you to stop right now!

Trixie: Listen to your father!

Stripe: Let's split up!

Trixie: Good idea!

Trixie runs off to the sofa, meanwhile Stripe continues chasing Muffin

Bluey: Ah! They're working together!

Stripe: Muffin, get back here now!

Muffin: No!

Muffin: Where are they?

Bingo: Your mum's hiding behind the couch!

Muffin: What couch?

Bingo: The couch!

Muffin: We've got lots of couches!

Bingo: It's that couch right there!

Muffin runs to the couch Trixie is hiding behind

Trixie: Got you! Muffin!

Muffin falls, Stripe trips over Trixie

Muffin: I'M FREE!!

Stripe and Trixie: Muffin!

Muffin, trying to run away again, trips on a bone toy and flings the phone up in the air from the verandah.

Stripe: NO! My phone!

Muffin, Trixie, Stripe, Bluey, and Bingo watch as the phone flies up into the air, then falls into the pool.

Bluey: Oh boy..

Muffin: Sorry, dad.

Stripe: Muffin?

Muffin: Yes?

Stripe and Trixie: TIMEOUT.

Muffin: Okay.

Muffin walks to timeout, the call glitches and ends on Stripe's device, and Socks finishes her drawing.

Socks: Finish!

Bluey: Oh, wow, that's great, Socks!

Socks: Thanks.

Bingo: Can I have a turn now, Bluey?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, sure.

Bingo: Thanks.

Bluey: No problem, because we know what happens when you hog.

Bandit: "That's me when I was 10 years old, on holiday with Uncle Rad and Uncle Stripe."

Cutting back to the present day, oh boy this is gonna get repetitive.

Bluey: "Hang on, where's your helmet?"

Bandit: "This was the 80's, man, there were no helmets! It was a wild place."

Cutting back to flashback

Bandit: "Trampoline with no nets, your mum wrote your name on everything, BMX seats were high, music were on cassettes, and skids were big."

It cuts to Bandit skidding, then Radley.

Flashback Bandit: "Woah, good skid, Rad!"

Stripe tries to skid, but what comes out is a screeching sound.

Flashback Bandit: "You can't skid, Stripe!"

Flashback Stripe: "Yes I can!"

Flashback Bandit: "No you can't! And mum wants you!"

Flashback Stripe: "Huh?"

Flashback Bandit: "Make you look, ya dirty chook! Haha! SUFFER!"

Cutting back to the present day.

Bluey and Bingo gasp.

Bluey: "You’re teasing Stripe!"

Bandit: "Afraid so."

Bingo: "But that's mean!"

Bandit: "I told you, this fairy tale is about a mean brother, me!"

The kids gasp, again.

Bandit: "But don't worry, I was about to learn my lesson."

Cutting back to the flashback, where they paused on before continuing.

Flashback Radley: "Bandit, stop teasing Stripe!"

Flashback Bandit: "Make me! Hey Stripe, your wheels aren't turning!"

Flashback Stripe: Riding the bike "Huh? Aaaahhh!" Falling off his bike offscreen.

Flashback Bandit: "Haha! Make you look you dirty—"

Flashback Bandit & Radley: "Chook!"

Flashback Radley: "Jinx!"

It stops like a VHS tape before cutting back into the present

Bluey: "Huh?"

Bingo: "What's Jinx?"

Bandit: "Okay, in the 80's, if 2 people say the exact same word in the exact same time like:"

Cutting back to the flashback, with a reverse effect to when they both said truck, then a slow-mo with Bandit and Rad saying jinx before cutting back to the present day.

Bandit: "One of you will yell out “jinx”."

Cutting to the flashback again, with Radley saying jinx.

Bandit: "Meaning you had 10 seconds to touch them.

They both drop their bikes and Flashback Bandit starts to chase Flashback Radley.

Intense pursuit chase

Flashback Radley: "1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6!"

Flashback Radley tips over a bucket with a crab in it, which Flashback Bandit avoids a crab that got tipped.

Flashback Radley: "7! 8! 9! 10!"

Bandit, speaking over Flashback Radley counting: "If you didn't touch him in that 10 seconds, they'd say—"

Flashback Radley: "Skint!"

Cutting back to present day

Bandit: "And then, they can never speak again."

The kids gasp.

Bingo: "What? So you can't speak forever and ever?"

Bandit: "Nope, you were cursed."

Bluey: "Wow."

Cutting back to the flashback, with Flashback Bandit and Flashback Stripe playing an arcade game looking to as teamed Street Fighter.

Bandit: "The only thing that could break the curse was if that someone says your name."

Flashback Stripe: "Do you want me to say your name?"

Flashback Bandit nods

Flashback Stripe: "Ok, Band.....diddums! Ha!"

Cutting back to present day.

Bluey: "Can't you just say your own name?"

Bandit: "Nope, not allowed to speak."

Bluey: "What happens if you do speak?"

Bandit: "Oh, well, look, I shouldn't tell you, but" Inaudible whispering

If you actually curious, the loser basically owes the winner a drink, mainly a coke.

Bluey & Bingo: "What?"

Bingo: "That's terrible!"

Bandit: "I told you, the 80's was a wild place."

Cutting back to the flashback, with Nana going to order something while her kids play.

Bandit: "Anyway, being cursed is not a lot of fun when you're on holiday."

Flashback Nana: "Kids, you want your fish battered or crumbed?"

Flashback Radley: "Battered."

Flashback Stripe: "Battered!"

Flashback Nana: "How about you? Come on, speak up!"

Flashback Radley: "He wants crumbed."

Flashback Nana: "Ok."

Flashback Stripe: "Yeah, he loves crumbed. Don’t you, Ban... DISHWASHER! Ha!"

Cutting to a outdoor lunch table in the flashback

Bandit: "Ugh, I hated crumbed."

Cutting to the house thing their renting for holiday in the flashback

Flashback Nana: "WHO ATE ALL THE MINI CEREALS?"

Flashback Radley & Stripe: "He did!" They point at Flashback Bandit

Flashback Nana: "All right you, get over here!" She takes off her thongs on her feet and starts chasing Bandit, while Bandit starts running.

Flashback Radley and Stripe giggle as Flashback Bandit is getting chased.

Cutting back to the present day.

Bluey: "Geez, Nana was a bit mean."

Bandit: "Yeah, it was the 80s. Mums were allowed to be mean."

Cutting to the flashback with Flashback Radley and Stripe just poking around in the estuary while Flashback Bob was harvesting clams there.

Bandit: "Dads weren't help either."

Flashback Stripe: "Let's see who can shout the loudest!"

Flashback Radley: "Ok."

Both of them shout as loud as they can.

Flashback Bob: "Kids, keep it down!"

Bandit walks in and taps Bob.

Flashback Bob: "What do you want, Stripe, dah.. Rad, dah.. Gerald, agh whatever your name is!"

Bandit taps himself, showing that he wants him to say his name.

Flashback Bob: "What are you on about?" Looking at Flashback Stripe & Rad "What's on he about?"

Flashback Stripe: "Rad jinxed him! He can't talk until someone says his name!"

Flashback Bob: "All right, so you want me to say your name so you can talk again. Well, you’re dreamin’, mate! Y'know what I call this? I call this a good start. How do I say jinx so none of you can talk?"

Flashback Radley & Stripe: "Dad.."

Flashback Bob: "Is it like this? (He waves his hands around) OooOooh.."

Cutting to the bay where Flashback Stripe & Radley were throwing rocks? Looks like the sunset there, also Flashback Bandit was sitting there while his mum approached him.

Bandit: "I was never going to talk again. No one was going to say my name."

Flashback Nana: "I'm not going to say your name." Sits down next to Bandit "I think this will do you some good, for all holiday, you've been mean to your little brother."

Exhibit Alpha

Flashback Stripe is trying to Tic Tac on a skateboard, while Flashback Bandit is watching.

Flashback Bandit: "You can't tic tac, Stripe!"

Exhibit Beta

Flashback Bandit and Radley playing on an arcade machine, from the perspective on the arcade game screen, with Flashback Stripe in the middle wanting to play.

Flashback Stripe: "It's my turn now!"

Flashback Bandit: "No it isn't!" Shoving Stripe out of the way, without any arms.

Exhibit Gamma

Flashback Stripe just fell off his bike on the ground currently, while Flashback Bandit skids to him.

Flashback Bandit: "Haha, nice stack!"

Cutting back to the beach.

Flashback Nana: "This is a chance for you to have a good think about it."

Bandit: "Nana was right, not about a perm but about me, I haven't been a really good brother to Stripe. I deserved to be cursed."

Cutting to present day

Bingo: "So, when did the curse get broken?"

Bandit: "The very next morning actually."

Cutting to flashbacks, with Flashback Bandit with a toothbrush and a hat going to the shower block.

Bandit: "I was on my way to the shower block to clean my teeth."

Cut back to present day

Bluey: "All by yourself?!"

Bingo: "It was the 80s!"

Cutting back to flashback, with Bandit walking and noticing Stripe on prickly grass.

Flashback Stripe: "Mum! Ow!"

Bandit: "Stripe was taking a shortcut to the toilets, and got stuck in the prickles!"

Flashback Stripe: "Help!"

Cutting back to present day

Bluey: She gasped "So you can tell him you won't help him, unless he says your name!"

Bingo: "Oh yeah!"

Bandit: "You were right, I could've done that."

Cutting back to flashback, Flashback Stripe looks at Flashback Bandit.

Bluey: "So did you?"

Bandit: "Nah, I just helped him."

Flashback Bandit throws his hat for Flashback Stripe to jump on, then on the sidewalk.

Flashback Stripe: "Thanks, Ban.. dina! Haha!"

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

Cutting back to present day

Bluey: "You helped him and even then he didn't say your name?!"

Bandit: "Heh, that's brothers, kid."

Cutting back to flashback

Bandit: "To tell you the truth, I was proud of him."

Flashback Bandit mouth turns into a grin.

Cutting back to present day

Bingo: "So what broke the curse?"

Bandit: "Well, remember I said that this fairy tale has a princess?"

Cutting back to flashback

Flashback Chilli: "Bandit.. Heeler, is this your hat?"

Flashback Bandit looks behind him, seeing Chilli in what looks to be a She-Ra costume

Bluey: "Is that, mum?"

Cutting back to present day

Bandit: "That's mum."

Bluey and Bingo: "What?!"

Chilli: "Don't listen to him, it wasn't me." Standing in the doorway.

Bandit: "Don't listen to her, it was!"

Chilli: Approaches the 3. "Well look, it might've been. We used to go on holiday on that Caravan Park."

Bandit: "Case closed."

Chilli: "But, I've got no memory of that happening."

Bandit: "Oh, it's like a dagger in my heart."

Bingo: "How did she know your name?"

Cutting to flashback, with Flashback Bandit's hat with it's name on it.

Bandit: "It was written on my hat."

Bingo: "Wow."

Cutting back to present day

Chilli: "Either way, it's a good story."

Bluey: "But, is it true, or not true? I need to know!"

Bandit: "Well, I guess you have to decide. Do you believe in fairy tales?"

Cutting to the full moon, then to Bandit and Chilli putting the kids to bed, before they both approach and hold both hands together. Then cutting to the flashback, with Flashback Chilli approaching Flashback Bandit with his hat.

Flashback Chilli: "Here you go." She gives the hat to Flashback Bandit

Flashback Bandit: "Thanks."

Flashback Chilli: "See you later." Proceeding to run away back.

Flashback Bandit: "Yea, see you later."

The end credits play out, with Flashback Bandit's hat being thrown in the credits on the left side.

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, and an argument at breakfast.

Bluey: You did!

Bandit: I didn't!

Bluey: You did!

Bandit: I did not!

Bluey: Did!

Chilli walks in

Chilli: (yawns) What's going on?

Bluey: Dad blew off right in my face!

Bandit: Did not!

Chilli: Ugh. Bandit, that's a new low!

Bandit: I didn't do it! Why doesn't anyone believe me?

Bingo: 'Cause you're the king of fluffies!

Chilli: I know how to settle this.

Chilli picks up a wooden spoon

Bingo: Yeah! Whack him!

Chilli: What? No.

Chilli taps table with said spoon, much like a gavel.

Chilli: Family meeting.

Bluey and Bingo: Oh!

TITLE CARD: "Family Meeting"

Chilli: This episode of Bluey is called "Family Meeting"

END TITLE CARD

Bluey: Time to pay Fluffy King!

Chilli catches up with the rest, with curlers on, looking almost like a judge's wig.

Chilli: Sorry, just had to put my curlers in.

Chilli taps spoon on table

Chilli: Alright, three rules: one person talks at a time, everyone says, "fluffy" when talking about Dad's... fluffy,

Bandit: Alleged fluffy.

Chilli: …and most importantly everyone tells the truth.

Bluey raises hand

Chilli: (points at Bluey) Yes, you.

Bluey: Do we say that Dad "fluffied" or Dad "fluffed"?

Bandit: Allegedly.

Chilli: Either.

Bluey: What about "he was baking brownies"?

Bluey and Bingo laugh

Bandit: Allegedly!

Chilli taps table

Chilli: Enough.

Bingo: What does "allegebly" mean?

Chilli: It means you both get to tell your side of the story and then I decide who's telling the truth, okay?

Bandit: Yes, Your Honour.

Chilli:(interested) Ooh, I like that. Fourth rule, everyone calls me your honour. Okay, Bluey, you first.

Bluey: Yes, Your Honour.

Scene cuts to a reconstruction on the table, starting with a toy bed and bedside.

Bluey: It all happened this morning. (Places a small dog toy on the bed) Mum, this you asleep, this is me (places a smaller dog toy beside the bed).

Chilli: And where was Dad?

Bingo searches through the toy box for a prop, and pulls out a toy skunk. The girls laugh as Bluey gleefully puts it on the bed next to "Mum".

Bluey: Here!

Bandit: (offended) Hey, your honor!

Chilli: I'll allow it.

Bluey: So I was just here, um, doing something, and Dad got out of bed (picks up "Dad"), turned (turns "him" around) and fluffied right in my face! (raspberries to mimic said fluffy, then gags and coughs)

Chilli: Well, I heard enough.

Bandit: (To Chilli) Hey, hang on!

Chilli: Oh yeah. Your side. Make it quick.

Bandit: (To Bingo) Here, give me.

Bingo gives Bandit the box of toys

Bandit: Check it. (Replaces Bluey's prop for Chilli with a prettier one) Mum was here sleeping, looking gorgeous as usual.

Chilli: Oh, well... (giggles)

Bingo and Bluey look annoyed

Bingo: Hey!

Bluey: You're trying to make Mum like you more!

Bandit: I got up, went downstairs, and got embroiled in this mess.

Bluey: Hey!

Bandit: What!

Bluey: You missed the bit where you fluffied!

Bingo: "Allegbly".

Bandit: It just doesn't sound like the sort of thing I'd do.

The rest of the family react in surprise

All but Bandit: Oh-oh-oh, yes it does!

Bandit: What!?

Flashback; the family are in an elevator. Bluey is resting next to Chilli and Bingo looks bored. Bandit, however, has a trick for her

Bandit: Hey Bingo, pull my finger. (shows finger to Bingo)

Bingo reacts to it as Mum and Bluey become startled hearing that

Bingo: Okay! (proceeds to pull said finger as Bandit prepares for the punchline)

Chilli and Bluey: (hopelessly) Bingo, NO!!

End flashback

Bandit: Well, fair enough. But on the morning of this morning, I did not bake a brownie!

Bluey: Ooh, I've got a idea.

Cuts back to table. Bluey pushes a can of beans and toast on a plate on a sign showing that it's exhibit "a".

Bluey: Is this what you had for breakfast yesterday? Baked beans on wheat toast?

Bandit: Yep.

Bluey: (walks to the next exhibit, a jar of sauerkraut) Bingo, what's the fluffy level on this?

Bingo: (doots as she rises the "fluffy meter"). High.

Bluey: Thank you. And then what did you have for lunch, Mr. Heeler?

Bandit: Ah, just some, um... (discretely) Sauerkraut?

Bluey: Excuse me?

Bandit: (clearly) Sauerkraut.

Bluey: Bingo, fluffy level?

Bingo: (doots and rises the "fluffy meter" higher)

Bluey: Now we had dinner at Indy's house, didn't we?

Bandit: Yep.

Bluey: Can you tell us what you ate?

Bandit: Uh, I'm not sure I ate much.

Chilli: Mr. Heeler!

Bandit: (defeated) Okay, I had a vegan nut roast.

Bingo: Poor dear! (rises meter again)

Bluey: Anything else?

Bandit: Uh, nothing comes to mind.

Bluey: Really? Nothing from the petrol station on the way home that might have gone on this tray? (lifts cloth over exhibit "c", revealing a small empty pie tin)

Bingo and Chilli gasp

Bandit: Oh, well, maybe I had a pie!

Chilli: (disappointed) Oh, Bandit!

Bandit: Well, all I had was nut roast!

Bluey: Bingo, where is the fluffy meter now?

Bingo: (doots as she maximizes the meter) At the top!

Chilli: Sounds like you were ready to blow.

Bandit: My food choices are not on trial!

A closeup on Chilli's hand as she bangs the table again, then cuts to the hearing chair of said table with Bingo on it

Bluey: Bingo, on the morning of this morning, did you see Dad fluffy in my face?

Bingo: Yes, I did.

Bandit: Oh, what?! Bingo, you weren't even there!

Bingo: (giggles) Yes, I was!

Bluey: Thank you, Bingo. You can leave. (whispers to her) Here's a lollipop. (gives Bingo said lollipop Bluey conveniently hid on her back)

Bingo squeals in joy as Bandit discovers this dishonesty

Bandit: Hey, Your Honour!

Chilli: (gets up from her chair) Bingo, are you fibbing to get a lollipop?

Bluey looks sheepish,

Bingo: Yes! (giggles)

…then concerned as Bingo dobbed on her

Chilli: Give me that.

Bingo: Aw... (disappointed, as she passes it to Bluey who then passes it to Chilli)

Chilli: (to Bandit) Forget that bit. (to Bluey) Bluey, that has not helped your case. Remember, the truth will set you free.

Bluey: Okay, Mum.

Bandit: (coughs) I would like to call on... Mum!

Bluey and Bingo gasp

Chilli: Me!?

Cuts to table with the reconstruction bed, with similar setup as previously, then the hearing chair, this time with Chilli.

Bandit: Mrs. Heeler, on the morning of this morning, you didn't hear me fluffy, did you?

Chilli: No.

Bandit: Let's repeat that, you didn't hear me fluffy.

Bluey: 'Cause she was asleep!

Chilli: Yeah. Well, I wasn't asleep. I was dozing. I mean, (to Bandit) I heard you get up and move the bedside table.

Bandit looks surprised

Bandit: What?

Bluey: Oh, really? (to Chilli) Tell me about this bedside table.

Bandit: (hastily) Um, no further questions, You Honour. You can go now, come on. Get.

Cuts back to reconstruction bed

Chilli: Well, Dad charges the tablet on his bedside table at night. And sometimes he knocks it off when he gets up.

Cuts back to hearing chair, as Bandit beside Chilli gets increasingly neurotic

Chilli: And he has to move the table to get it. And it makes this horrible scraping sound like, (tries to vocalize what she heard, then comes realization) oh, no!

Bluey: He didn't move the table! That sound was the fluffy!

Bingo screams as she holds on to her sister.

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit: (nervously) Well, maybe we should here from... Uh, that guy? (points to a direction)

All but Bandit: (looking at the direction) What guy?

Bandit makes a run for it

Bluey and Bingo: Ah! He's running away!

Chilli: Get him, kids!

The kids has their dad in pursuit around the house

Bandit: You'll never catch me alive!

Bandit leaps over a couch then tries to hide behind a plant. After he thinks his kids lost him, he makes another run for it. Fortunately, they manage to get to him in time as he was about to get off from the backyard.

Bandit: Freedom!

Bandit jumps to the backyard, followed by the kids. They are finally able to subdue him as they triumphantly giggle and tickle him.

Bandit:: Ah, get off me! (laughs)

Scene cuts to another closeup of Chilli hitting the table, followed by a shot of Dad tied up with a jump rope held by Bingo, all next to Bluey.

Chilli: (to Bandit) Is there something you'd like to say?

Bandit: Whoever smelt it, dealt it?

Chilli: (knocks the table again as all eyes are closer to Bandit) Mr. Heeler!

Bandit: Okay, okay, I fluffied.

Chilli: In your child's face?

Bandit: Her face is at bum level! It's hard not to!

Chilli: Well, I seem to manage.

Bandit: Oh, like you don't bake the odd brownie.

Chilli: Bandit!

Bingo: That could've been me!

Chilli knocks the table as she states the sentence

Chilli: I sentence you to one hour playing "Horsey Ride", with the defendant (points at Bluey), and her sister (points at Bingo).

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Chilli: See, Bluey? The truth will set you free.

Bandit: Well, let's test that out, shall we? I have one last question.

Chilli: Okay.

Bandit: (walks closer to Bluey, Bingo holds him) The truth's gonna set someone free. Bluey, what were you doing at bum level on the morning of this morning?

Bluey: Oh! Uh...

Chilli: Bluey?

Bluey: Okay. I was playing computer games on the tablet.

Chilli gasps

Bandit: Even though Mum said you weren't allowed to play computer games until the weekend?

Bluey: (sheepishly giggles) Yes.

Chilli: Bluey Christine Heeler! (knocks the table again) I sentence both of you to horsey rides. Saddle up, Bingo!

Bingo: Hooray! ("whips" Bandit with a sticky hand then runs off squealing)

Bandit: Hey!

Bandit, now without Bingo, puts down the jump rope around his waist. Bluey walks up to him.

Bluey: I'm sorry, Dad.

Bandit: I'm sorry, Bluey.

They both hug, which is followed by Chilli getting up after pushing the chair away, with a rather strange sound.

Chilli: (knocks table again, hastily) Okay, family meeting over, everyone out!

Bandit: Huh?

Chilli: Come on, quickly! (starts waving her hands to shoo them away)

Bluey: Why do we have to leave so fast?

Bandit: Yeah, what's the hurry?

Chilli: Come on, out!

Bandit: Hang on...

Chilli and Bluey: What's that smell?

Bandit: Out, out, come on!

Bandit and Bluey: (gasp, then point to Chilli, who looks sheepish) Mum fluffied!

(Chilli stops flapping hands and looks sheepish)

[Theme song]

The episode opens with Bluey, Bandit, Chilli, and Bingo playing Pop Up Croc in their living room. It is Bluey's turn, and she carefully puts a crocodile into one of the bowl's sides as her family anxiously watch on.

Bluey: Ehh... easy...

Bingo: Eh, Bluey, be safe!

Bluey puts her crocodile into the bowl's side, but the person pops up when she does so, shocking the family.

All: Aah!

Everyone except for Bluey laughs.

Bluey: Aww, not fair!

Bandit: How good's Pop Up Croc?

Bluey puts the person back into the bowl.

Bluey: Again!

Chilli: No, upstairs for bedtime.

Bluey immediately runs outside, yelling. Bingo follows her, giggling.

Bandit: Oh, here we go.

Bluey runs outside, still yelling, as fruit bats fly off into the night. Bluey and Bingo stop and watch them.

Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!

TITLE CARD - a rugby ball, a bitten-into papaya slice, and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Fruitbat!

Bandit walks outside to the kids, holding a rugby ball.

Bandit: Alright, say goodnight to the animals. Goodnight, frogs!

Bingo: Night, kangaroos. Night, bilbies.

Bandit: Night, fruit bats!

Bingo: No, not night fruit bats. They don't sleep at night. They're octurnal.

Bandit: Good knowledge, kid.

Bluey: You mean fruit bats don't need to go to bed now?

Bandit: No.

He kicks the ball off into the yard.

Bandit: But you do. Come on, bedtime.

Bandit and Bingo go to walk back inside.

Bluey: I wish I was a fruit bat.

Bandit: Well, fruit bats don't get to do rocket ship.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, rocket ship!

Bluey and Bingo run inside the house. Cut to Bandit holding Bluey and Bingo at the bottom of the stairs as a part of playing rocket ship.

Bingo: Ok, helmets.

Bluey and Bingo mime putting on helmets as Bluey makes a putting-on-helmet sound.

Bluey: Seatbelts!

They mime putting on seatbelts.

Bluey and Bingo: Click!

Bingo: Close the door.

They both mime closing the door.

Bluey: Clunk.

Bingo [overlapping]: Click.

Bluey: Ok, push the button!

They both mime pushing a button on Bandit's chest.

Bluey and Bingo: Boop!

Bandit mimics the noise of a rocket taking off, running up the stairs and taking a giggling Bluey and Bingo with him. Bandit lands outside the bathroom.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Bandit: Ok, shower time.

Bandit lets Bingo down and she runs into the bathroom, but Bluey clings tightly to him.

Bluey: No, more rocket ship! I don't need a shower.

Bandit: Yeah, you do, ya grub.

Bandit sniffs Bluey and is disgusted by the smell.

Bandit: Poahh!

He puts Bluey down.

Bluey: Not fair. I bet fruit bats don't have to have showers.

Bandit: Well, then they wouldn't get to play penguins.

Bluey: Yeah, penguins!

Bluey runs into the bathroom.

(Note: The scene that follows is cut from international versions of the episode due to the penguin game - which involves Bluey sliding on water on the bathroom floor - being considered too dangerous for kids.)

Bluey takes a mug and pours water on the floor. She then slides around on the floor like a penguin while Bingo is showering with an umbrella and wiping her hand on the misted glass.

Bluey: Whee!

Chilli walks in.

Chilli: Teeth time.

Bluey: Mum! Look, I'm a penguin!

Bluey slides around some more.

Bluey: Whee!

Chilli: Oh, whackadoo!

Later, Bingo is on the toilet while reading a book.

Bingo: Even though I don't really need to do a wee, I'm going to do one anyway, otherwise I might wet the bed.

Bandit is just outside the toilet, drying Bluey while she is brushing her teeth.

Bandit: That's very clever, Bingo.

Bingo: It's called a tactical wee.

Bluey: Not fair. I wanna stay up like the fruit bat.

Bandit: Well, when the fruit bats go to the toilet, they do it hanging upside down, so the wee just runs all over them!

Bandit tickles Bluey.

Bandit: Blech!

Bluey: Ugh! I'd love that!

Bandit: I bet you would, you little grub!

Later, in the kids' bedroom, Bluey is jumping on her bed and flapping her arms like a fruit bat. Chilli is brushing Bingo's fur on the other bed.

Bluey: Eee! Eee!

Bluey lands on the floor as Bandit comes in with a book.

Bandit: Come on, that's a daytime game.

Bluey: Aww, I just wanna be a fruit bat.

Bandit: Yeah, yeah, I know. But fruit bats don't get to play the story game, where I tell a story but pretend to fall asleep.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Cut to Bandit in Bluey's bed, reading a story to Bluey and Bingo, who are lying either side of him.

Bandit: So, the little puppy peeked in the window, and on the table was the most beautiful-

Bandit pretends to fall asleep, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle, then shake him awake.

Bluey and Bingo: Wake up!

Bandit: (snorts awake) Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry. I think I must have just dozed off. Now, where was I? Oh yeah... the most beautiful golden egg she'd ever seen. So she climbed inside, but out jumped a huge, hairy-

Bandit pretends to fall asleep again, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle.

Bluey and Bingo: Wake up!

Bandit: (snorts awake) Spider!

Bingo and Bluey giggle more. Later, Bandit and Chilli are saying goodnight to the kids. Chilli kisses Bingo.

Bluey: Aww, I'm not tired.

Chilli: I know. Just try, Ok?

Bluey: It's not fair.

Chilli: Night, Bluey.

Bluey tries going to sleep, but she can't. She groans and wriggles and kicks the bedsheets off her.

Bluey: Ugh! I can't fall asleep! Psst, Bingo, are you awake?

Cut to Bingo, fast asleep and starfishing in her bed, separate from all her sheets and her pillow.

Bluey: Hmmph!

In the living room, Bandit is fast asleep on the floor with the rugby ball. Chilli is putting tape on her hockey stick when she hears the stairs creak. She looks up and sees Bluey on top of the staircase.

Chilli: Bluey!

Bluey walks down to Chilli.

Chilli: What am I gonna do with you, hey?

Bluey: Let me stay up?

Chilli: Ehh...

Bluey sees Bandit, who starts moving around while in his sleep, grapppling with the ball. Bluey giggles.

Bluey: What's Dad doing?

Chilli: Hmm. I'd say he's dreaming about playing touch football with his mates.

Bluey: Really?

Chilli: Yeah. He doesn't get to play that much anymore, so he keeps having dreams about it.

Bluey: Why doesn't he get to play it for real life?

Chilli: Well, he's busy, sweetheart. Busy working and looking after you two.

Bluey: Oh.

Bandit puts the ball down and starts cheering in his sleep.

Bluey: Oh, look! Did he just score a try?

Chilli: I think he did.

Bluey giggles, then realises.

Bluey: Ooh, maybe I can dream about being a fruit bat.

Chilli: Well, you could give it a go.

Bluey runs back up the stairs to her bedroom.

Bluey: Night, Mum!

Chilli: Oh. Ok. Night, honey.

Later, Bluey is back in her bed, still trying to fall asleep.

Bluey: Come on! Come on! (groans) Dream about being a fruit bat!

Bluey opens her eyes to find out she's still awake, and groans in annoyance. In the living room, Chilli is putting a huge crocodile in an even bigger Pop Up Croc bowl as Bluey walks down the stairs - confirming that Bluey is now dreaming.

Bluey: It didn't work.

Chilli: Oh well, you tried.

Bluey: Where'd Dad go?

Chilli: He's outside.

Bluey heads out onto the verandah.

Bluey: Dad!

Bluey looks up at the sky, then starts flapping her arms like wings and flies up to join some fruit bats in the night sky.

Bluey: Dad! Dad!

Bluey flies through the suburb, past Mackenzie's house where he is sleeping in his bed, then lands in a mango tree and hangs upside down on the branches while eating one. She does the same with a papaya tree, a banana tree, and a guava tree. She burps, then hears Bandit's voice.

Bandit [from a distance]: Mine!

Bluey flies over to see Bandit playing touch football with Rocko, Stripe, Pat, Mackenzie's Dad, and another dog - just as Chilli told her earlier. She hangs upside down on some stadium lights and watches Bandit play.

Pat [offscreen]: Bandit!

Bandit: Yes mate, yes mate, yes mate!

Mackenzie's Dad [offscreen]: Kick it!

Pat [offscreen]: Right, run!

Rocko [offscreen]: Whoa!

Bandit scores a try and celebrates.

All: Yeah!

Bluey calls to Bandit from the light.

Bluey: Hey, Dad!

Bandit: Hey, Bluey! You're a fruit bat!

Bluey: Yeah!

Bandit: How is it?

Bluey: It's great! You get to eat a lot of fruit!

Bandit: Ha! I bet! Hey, did you see my try?

Bluey: Yeah, I did!

Bandit: How good was it!

Bluey: So good.

Bandit turns to Pat and Mackenzie's Dad.

Bandit: There's plenty more where that came from!

Mackenzie's Dad elbows Bandit playfully as Pat throws the ball over to Bandit.

Mackenzie's Dad: Ha ha, ya reckon?

Pat [overlapping]: Yeah, sure.

Bandit: Yeah, I do!

Bandit elbows Mackenzie's Dad back. Pat laughs.

Mackenzie's Dad: Oh, righto.

Pat and Mackenzie's Dad walk off.

Bandit: Alright, see ya Bluey.

He runs after his mates.

Bandit: Come on, let's do this!

Bluey: See ya, Dad!

Bluey flies off, upwards and in front of the moon. One of the clouds then transitions back to Bluey's bed, where it is now the next morning. Bluey wakes up.

Bluey: Wow!

In the kitchen, Bandit is doing sit-ups while Chilli and Bingo are having fruit salad. Bluey walks in.

Bluey: Hi!

Chilli: 7 o'clock? That was a big sleep.

Bluey: I had the most amazing dream.

Bandit picks up Bluey and starts bench pressing her.

Bandit: One, two, three...

Bluey: Dad?

Bandit: ...four, five, six... Yes, mate? ...seven...

Bluey: Thanks for looking after us.

Bandit: ...eight, nine, ten!

Bandit puts Bluey down on him and touches her nose.

Bandit: You're welcome.

Bluey giggles.

Chilli: I've got your favourite, Bluey. Fruit salad!

Bluey: Yuck! No more fruit. Just some toast, please.

Chilli and Bingo are surprised with Bluey's response. They look at each other.

Bingo: (hums "I don't know")

[End credits]

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a piano-based tune with vocals. Bluey is dancing.

Bandit: Oh-ho! That was a big one.

Chilli: Charming.

Bluey and Bingo run into the room.

Bluey: Mum, can you and Dad smoochy kiss?

Bandit: Yup.

Bandit turns his head to kiss Chilli, but before he could do that, she blocked him with a book she was reading.

Chilli: Not so fast! Why do you want us to smoochy kiss?

Bingo: Because we like it.

Bluey: Yeah, it's very romance.

Chilli: Where did you learn that word?

Bluey: TV.

Bingo: We know all about romance.

Chilli: Well, maybe you could teach your dad about that.

Nail flies off.

Bandit: Outrageous!

Bluey: Yeah, let's teach Dad!

Bingo: We can set up the restaurant.

Bluey: The Fancy Restaurant!

Bingo: Yeah!

This episode of Bluey is called Fancy Restaurant.

Bandit and Chilli walk in the imaginary Fancy Restaurant.

Bandit: I'll show you a thing or two about romance.

Chilli: Ooh, can't wait.

Bluey: Hello. Welcome to the Fancy Restaurant. Are you husband and wife?

Bandit grabs Chilli by the hand.

Bandit: Yes, we are.

Chilli lets go of Bandit's hand.

Chilli: No, we aren't.

Bandit: Huh?

Chilli: This is our first date. We met five minutes ago.

Bluey: Very good. Do you have a booking?

Bandit: Ah, yes. The name's Romeo McFlourish.

Bluey: Hmm, Romeo.

She slides her finger down the booking list.

Bluey: Nope, never heard of you.

Bandit: Oh. Well, can we have a table anyway?

Bluey: You'll have to make a booking.

Bandit: Well, I'd like to make a booking, please.

Bluey: No, you have to call.

Bandit: Ugh. OK. Boop. Ring-ring.

Bluey: Hello?

Bandit: Hi. I'd like to make a booking, please.

Bluey: Name?

Bandit: Romeo... Oh, uh, what was it?

Chilli: McFlourish.

Bandit: McFlourish. Of course.

Bluey: OK, great. See you soon. Bee-boop. Hi, do you have a booking?

Bandit: Yes, McFlourish.

Bluey: Oh, yes. Right this way, please.

Bandit: Finally.

Chilli: Smooth, Romeo.

Bandit and Chilli are sitting at a table.

Bandit: I have, of course, taken you to the fanciest restaurant in town.

Bingo enters holding a pan with a can of beans on it.

Bingo: Baked beans!

She slams the pan on the table which scares both Bandit & Chilli.

Chilli: Oh, dear.

Bluey: Not yet, Chef Bingo.

Bingo takes the frying pan and starts to leave the room with Bluey following her.

Bingo: Have they smoochy kissed yet?

Bluey: No, not yet.

Bluey turns around and walks back to the table.

Bluey: I'm so sorry. She's new. Now, these are the menus. You also have some forks and spoons.

Bluey hands the menus to Bandit & Chilli.

Bandit: Told you this place was fancy.

Bluey: Now, what would you like to order?

Chilli: Could you tell me what the special is?

Bluey: Mm, I'm not sure. I'll check with the chef.

She turns around.

Bluey: HEY, CHEF!

Bingo: What?

Bluey: What's the special?

Bingo: The WHAT?

Bluey: THE SPECIAL!

Bingo: The WHAT?

Bluey makes a disappointed face and then turns around to Bandit & Chilli.

Bluey: There's no special.

Chilli: I'll just have the baked beans, then.

Bandit & Chilli hand the menus back to Bluey.

Bluey: Very good. I'll be right back. Please enjoy your cutlery.

Bluey walks away.

Bandit: [Standing up] Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.

Bandit runs to the imaginary kitchen.

Bandit: Hey, dodgy brothers. Haven't you got anything other than baked beans?

Bingo: What's wrong with baked beans?

Bandit: Well, they're not very romance.

Bingo: Hmm. Yeah, I guess we could make something else.

Bluey: Something special?

Bingo: Yeah, something special!

Bluey: Ooh, and I'll play some romance music.

Bingo giggles.

Bluey: Leave it to us. Now go and do a smoochy kiss.

Bluey starts pushing Bandit back to the table.

Bandit: Hey!

Bandit: Oh. I'm back.

Bandit sits down.

Chilli: So, has the romance started yet?

Bandit: Very soon, my darling... Uh, what's your name again?

Chilli: Oh! Super smooth.

Bluey starts playing annoying music on a keytar.

Bluey: Ooh, what's this? Some romance music.

Chilli: [Covering her ears] Oh. It's...lovely!

Bandit: [Trying to push away Bluey] So, ah...

Bluey: Hey!

Bandit: Tell me more about...

Bluey: Let go!

Bandit: ..your stuff.

Bandit falls off the chair and Bluey stops playing on the keytar.

Chilli: [Standing up] If you'll excuse me.

Bandit: What? You're leaving me?

Chilli: I'm just going to the bathroom.

Bluey: Oh, yes, it's just in that corner next to the bookshelf.

Chilli: Oh. Fancy.

Chilli walks away.

Bluey: Why haven't you smoochy kissed her yet?

Bandit: Well, how can I when you're making all that racket?

Bluey: You need to be more romance.

Bandit: I'm trying! I think I've just forgotten my moves. I guess it has been a while.

Bluey: Well, toughen up, Romeo. We wanna see a smoochy kiss.

The scene changes to the interior of a fridge.

Bingo: [Opens the fridge] Ooh. This looks special.

The scene changes back to the table.

Chilli: I'm back. [Sits down]

Bluey: Very good, madam.

Bandit: Ah, so, did you have a nice time in the toilet?

Chilli: Excuse me?

Bluey facepalms.

Bingo: Bluey, I need you!

Bluey: Just a moment.

She points her finger at Bandit:

Bluey: Be. Romance.

Bluey runs to the imaginary kitchen. She looks at the jelly with spaghetti and beans on it.

Bluey: Wow. So beautiful.

Bingo: I made a special.

Bluey: You used real food.

Bingo: Is that special?

Bluey: Yeah, that's really special.

Back at the table.

Chilli: There's no romance coming, is there?

Bandit: Ugh. No. I'm sorry. I may have forgotten how to be romance.

Chilli: Well, I have too. It's not easy when you're tired all the time.

Bandit: Yeah, and when you get interrupted every five...

Bluey: [Interrupting] Dinner!

Bluey places a can of beans on the table.

Bluey: Here's your baked beans. And here's your special dinner!

Bluey removes the cloth from the jelly made by Bingo.

Chilli: Wow. That is...special.

Bluey: Our chef made this especially for you.

Chilli: Oh, you shouldn't have.

Bluey: [Gives Chilli a spoon] Here you go, madam.

Chilli: Thank you. [Pretends to eat the jelly] Mm, so good.

Bluey: You can't just eat it pretend.

Bingo: Yeah, you have to eat it for real life.

Chilli: Oh. Um, the thing is...

Bingo: You don't like it?

Chilli: Um, well I do, but...

Bingo: You don't think it's special.

Bluey embraces Bingo while giving Chilli an angry look.

Chilli: Um, uh... It's just... Um...

Bandit: Hang on. I know this isn't very romantic, but can we swap? Yours looks delicious.

Both smile at each other.

Chilli: Oh, OK. I guess we could.

Chilli gives the spoon with the jelly to Bandit. He looks at it for a second.

Bandit: To romance.

He eats the jelly while making a disgusted face.

Bandit: Ohh. Ugh, it's great.

Bluey: You have to finish it.

Bandit: Oh. OK. Bleh! [Coughs] Oh, so good. Oh, man. I can't get enough of this.

The scene changes to the night sky with owls hooting in the background. The scene then changes back the the table with the empty plate.

Bandit puts the spoon on the plate. He then proceeds to cough.

Bluey: Would you like dessert?

Chilli: [Suddenly standing up] Ah, no! I mean, uh, this was such a special evening. I feel like taking a moonlit stroll with my new love.

Bingo: They're holding hands.

Bluey: Oh, yes. The moon is that way.

Chilli: This way, my special man. [She goes out into the backyard with Bandit]

Bluey: Well, they didn't smoochy kiss, but she is rubbing his back.

Bingo: Yeah, that's still romance.

Bluey: Yeah.

Bluey and Bingo walk back into the house. The episode ends with Bandit vomiting being cut off.

[Theme Song]

The episode opens in the Heelers’ playroom. Bingo is laying on her stomach on the kiwi rug, drawing a picture in green crayon. Bluey is holding up a small purple and blue ball. She throws it against the ground.

Bluey: Bounce!

The ball ricochets against the floor and then the ceiling. Bluey lets out a squeal and laughs as the ball bounces away.

Bluey: Hey Bingo, do you wanna play a game?

Bingo: Yeah.

Bluey: What should we play?

Bingo: How about we play the game where, um, uh… No, not that one, um, um, um…

Bluey slowly looks impatient.

Bluey: Let’s play hairdressers!

Bingo: Okay.

TITLE CARD - A purple clamp of pink hair chalk, and the episode title.

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Hairdressers.

The scene shifts to the bathroom connecting off of Bandit and Chilli’s room. Bingo is sweeping the floor while Bluey stands on a stool behind Chilli. Chilli has a green towel pinned around her. Various barrettes are fastened to her fur and a green claw clip is clamped on her left ear. Bluey pulls a purple clamp along Chilli’s right ear to apply pink hair chalk.

Bluey: So, you been up to much?

Chilli: Oh yeah, I’ve been-

Bluey: Oh that’s very interesting. Now, would you like both ears pink or one pink and one green?

Bingo: Bluey, can we do one, um, pink and the other, um, how about we uh…

Bluey: (continues applying hair chalk) I think we’ll do the pink.

Bingo: Aww.

Bluey finishes applying the chalk and wraps Chilli’s ear in blue and white striped paper.

Chilli: Bluey, you can’t keep talking over Bingo.

Bluey: But she takes so long to say her ideas.

Chilli: She’s having trouble finding her voice today. We have to help her.

Bluey: Oh. Have I found my voice?

Chilli: Yes, you have. (rolls her eyes) Now, you have to find your ears.

Bluey giggles and grabs her ears.

Bluey: Here they are!

Chilli: Bluey.

Bandit enters from the right.

Bandit: Hello, ladies.

Bluey: Ooh, another customer.

Bluey gets down from her stool and approaches Bandit. Bingo rushes over as well.

Bingo: Welcome to the hairdressers. Do you have a… um… um…

Bluey: An appointment?

Bingo: Yes, that thing.

Bandit: Well, of course. The name’s Burt. Burt Handsome.

Bingo: Ah yes, please um…

Bluey: Take a seat.

Bingo: Yes, what she said.

As Bingo leads “Burt Handsome” to another seat to the left of Chilli, Bluey whispers to Chilli.

Bluey: (whisper) See, I’m helping.

Bandit: (leans in towards Chilli) Hello there.

Chilli: Uh, hello.

The girls wrap a purple towel around Bandit as Bluey stands on a stool behind him. Chilli grabs a magazine from the sink counter and starts reading through it.

Bluey: Now what can we do for you today, Burt?

Bandit: Well, just make me look more handsome, if that’s even possible.

Bluey: (giggles) Okay.

Bluey makes a “scissors” shape with her fingers.

Bluey: Snip, snip, snip. So please, tell me what you been up to.

Bandit: Oh well, I just bought a new house because I have so much money and my last house was too small to fit in all the trophies I’ve won for being so handsome. And I also…

Bluey: Wait a minute.

Bingo: What is it?

Bluey jolts away from inspecting Bandit’s head.

Bluey: Ah! A nit!

Bandit: Huh?

Bluey: You’ve got nits!

Bandit: What?

Bluey: He’s got nits!

Bingo runs out of the room.

Bingo: Ah! Nits!

Bluey: Get down!

Bluey tackles Chilli to the ground.

Cut back to the title card. The original title is scribbled over in black marker and “Nits” is written under it crudely.

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is now called Nits.

Cut back to the bathroom- Bluey and Bingo are now cowering outside and watching Bandit fearfully.

Bandit: Are you sure it’s not just dandruff?

Bluey: Don’t move!

Bandit flinches upright.

Bingo: Bluey, maybe we could um, um, um…

Bandit: I don’t actually have a big house.

Bingo: Um, um…

Bluey: Come on, Bingo, this is an emergency!

Bandit: I live with my mum!

Bingo: We could…

Bingo points to the shower.

Bluey: Oh yeah, the shower.

The scene cuts to Bandit shut in the shower stall.

Bandit: So now what do I do?

Bluey: Turn on the tap!

Bandit: Um, okay. I’ll do it nice and warm.

Bingo: Uh no, um, it has to be um, um…

Bluey: It has to be a cold shower!

Bingo: Yes!

Bandit: What?

Bluey: Nits hate cold showers.

Bingo giggles.

Bandit: But, but…

Bluey: Do it.

Bandit: Ah well, I guess you’re the experts.

Bandit turns the handle on the shower to dispense cold water. He yelps out because of the cold as the girls giggle at him. He tries to play along and laughs hesitantly, before turning the tap back off.

Bandit: Whew! Okay, kids, that’s it for the nits.

As Bandit opens the shower door, the girls run back in. Bluey is holding a rubber hammer and Bingo is holding a fly swatter. They start to whack him with their items.

Bluey: Get the stragglers!

As Bandit cries out in pain, Bingo stops swatting to point out different locations for Bluey to target.

Bingo: There’s one. There’s another!

Bluey pauses as Bandit falls to his side.

Bluey: They’re all over his butt!

She hits Bandit again.

Bingo: He’s got butt nits!

Bluey: Aah! What are we gonna do, Bingo?

Bingo: Let’s get the um…

Bingo makes a bird beak gesture with her hand.

Bluey: Oh yeah!

The scene cuts to Bandit and Chilli’s room where Chilli is waiting on a bench, still reading a magazine. Bluey runs in and grabs a bird sculpture from the top of the dresser.

Bluey: Nit bird! Be right with you, madam!

Bluey runs back to the bathroom. Meanwhile, Bingo is following Bandit, who is trying to escape while crawling on all fours, and swatting his rear with her fly swatter.

Bingo: Butt nit!

Bluey returns, holding up the bird sculpture triumphantly.

Bluey: Nit bird!

Bluey makes the nit bird “peck” at Bandit.

Bluey: Nit, nit, nit!

Bluey makes a cawing sound.

Bluey: Nit, nit, nit, nit, nit.

Bluey makes more bird sounds as Bandit groans.

Bluey: It’s no use, Bingo. Get the cricket bat.

Bingo: Okay.

Bandit: What?

Bingo runs out of the room.

Chilli: Where are you going?

Bingo opens her mouth preemptively to speak.

Bluey: (calling out from off-screen) She’s getting the cricket bat!

Bingo nods and runs out into the hallway.

The scene cuts back to Bluey continuing to “peck” Bandit as Chilli enters.

Bluey: Nit, nit, nit!

Chilli: Bluey.

Bluey: Yeah?

Chilli: I’m so happy you’re not talking over Bingo…

Bluey: Yeah, I’m helping her find her voice.

Chilli: I know, but if you talk for her, she won’t find it either.

Bluey: Oh, so what should I do?

Chilli: You have to find your ears!

Bluey: They’re on my head!

Chilli: Bluey…

Bluey: Okay.

Bingo runs back in.

Bingo: I couldn’t find the cricket bat.

Bandit: It’s okay. I think the nits have all gone.

Bingo: Aw.

Chilli: There definitely wasn’t one or two left for Bingo?

Bandit: I don’t think so.

Bluey: Are you sure you’re not still a little bit itchy?

Bandit: Oh well…

Bandit pauses, looking at Bingo dragging her feet dejectedly. He starts to squirm and scratch himself.

Bandit: Ah! So itchy!

Bluey: He’s still got nits!

Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Hooray!

Chilli: What should we do, Bingo?

Bingo: Um, um, um… Bluey, you say it.

Bluey gets down from on top of Bandit.

Bluey: Okay, why don’t we… (hesitates) Hang on, no!

She approaches Bingo and grabs her ears.

Bluey: You keep going, Bingo.

Chilli smiles.

Bingo: Um, okay, I want to um, tie Dad upside down from the tree and throw water balloons at him (makes throwing motions) and then cover him in nit powder, (makes a dunking motion) which is flour, and then rake him with the rake! (makes clawing motions before raising her arms excitedly)

Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Yeah!

Bandit: What?!

Bluey: (hugs Bingo) You found your voice!

Chilli: And you found your ears! (ruffles the top of Bluey’s head)

Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Hooray!

Bandit: Hooray?

The scene cuts to outside in the backyard. Bandit is hanging upside down by his feet on the swing tied on the poinciana tree, the support rope twisted to the very top. Bluey and Bingo, each with a water balloon in hand, are standing on the bench under the tree. More water balloons are at their feet and two flour bags are on the ground nearby.

Bandit: Gee Bingo, when you find your voice, you sure find your voice.

Bingo raises her water balloon, backed by a dramatic green background.

Bingo: Nit bomb! Go!

Bluey and Bingo throw their water balloons at Bandit, both balloons bursting into a splash of water. Bingo readies a bag of flour backed by a purple background.

Bingo: Nit powder! Release!

She tosses out a large cloud of flour, covering Bandit and causing him to cough.

Bluey and Bingo each get their own diagonal cut of the screen as they hold up plastic rakes. Bluey’s is purple and Bingo’s is red. The background behind Bluey is a peach-ish orange, while Bingo’s is purple.

Bingo: Get the stragglers!

Bluey and Bingo scratch at Bandit, still covered in flour, with their rakes. They laugh for a bit, Bandit sounding pained. Bluey starts to smack Bandit with her rake, Bingo joining it for one hit before Bandit falls off the swing and onto his back.

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Back in the bathroom, Bluey is sweeping the floor while Bingo is holding out a wooden block to Bandit, still covered in flour.

Bingo: Just one thousand dollar bucks, please. Tap here.

Bandit taps a playing card to the block.

Bandit: Doot.

Bandit turns around and leaves, wordlessly.

Bingo: See you again soon.

Bandit enters the connecting bedroom, trailing flour behind him. Chilli is still reading her magazine.

Bandit: Hello.

Chilli: (jolts up) Oh!

Bluey and Bingo run into the room.

Bandit: I don’t have any nits. Would you like to have a cup of tea with me?

Chilli: Well, how could I resist that offer?

Chilli closes the magazine and gets up from her seat, offering a hand to Bandit.

Chilli: Shall we?

Bandit takes Chilli’s hand and the two walk off to the right. Bluey turns to Bingo.

Bluey: What should we play now?

Bingo: Ooh, I’ve got an idea.

Bluey: Ooh, okay, I’m listening.

[End credits]

During the end credits, Chilli is sitting on the bench, reading through her magazine. Her legs are crossed and she is swinging her foot absentmindedly.

[Theme Song]

The episode opens on the Heeler family's balcony outside of the kitchen. Bandit is standing on top of the table in front of the patio table and handing dirty leaves from the dirt-covered gutter down to the trash bag that Chilli is holding. As Bandit grabs for a second handful, part of the gutter falls and hits the railing, scattering some stray leaves. Bandit lets out a yelp as Chilli gasps.

Bandit: Ah, that’s no good.

Chilli: (grabs a stray leaf and adds it to her trash bag) This house is falling apart.

Bandit: Well, nothin’ lasts forever.

Chilli: Yeah, I guess.

Bandit: It’s just got character.

Bluey and Bingo enter, each holding a slice of watermelon, the “red” of Bluey’s slice being a somewhat paler color.

Bluey: Dad, Bingo’s watermelon is redder than mine.

Bandit: No, it isn’t.

Bingo: Yeah, it is.

Bluey: See?

Bandit: Oh, yeah. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

Bingo licks her watermelon slice.

Bluey: What does that mean?

Pat: (off screen, calling out) Hey Bandit!

The camera shifts to show the view towards Lucky’s yard, where Pat is standing next to a brick pizza oven. The Heelers move closer to the railing for a better view. The scene zooms in on Pat, surrounded by cardboard, tools, and paper instructions.

Pat: Check it out! (points to oven) New pizza oven! (leans an elbow on the edge of the pizza oven) Pretty sweet, aye?

The scene cuts back to the Heelers observing.

Pat: (off screen) I just got it from Hammerbarn!

Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!

Bandit: We’re going to Hammerbarn.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, Hammerbarn!

Chilli: Gee, his lawn’s looking green.

TITLE CARD - Two near identical garden gnome dogs, the left of which has a shovel under its arm, and the episode title.

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Hammerbarn.

The scene transitions to a wide view of the parking lot of the Hammerbarn hardware store.

Bluey: (off screen) Will the pizza taste better from the pizza oven?

Bandit: (off screen) Yep.

Chilli: (off screen) Nope.

The scene transitions to the inside of Hammerbarn. As Chilli picks out a trolley, Bluey and Bingo each have a small sausage covered in tomato sauce and wrapped in a slice of bread. Bluey takes a bite of hers.

Bingo: Dad, Bluey got more sauce than me.

Bandit: No, she didn’t.

Bandit approaches a Labrador employee.

Bandit: Hey, mate, where are your pizza ovens?

Employee: Aisle 300, left at the fake grass. If you hit a flamingo, you’ve gone too far.

The scene cuts back to Chilli rolling out a trolley.

Bluey and Bingo: Trolley!

Bandit: I’m going to aisle 300.

Bluey and Bingo quickly scarf down the rest of their sausages as Chilli sets a flat box of tomato wire in the trolley.

Chilli: Okay, we’ll head to the garden center. Come on, kids.

Chilli lifts Bluey, who props up the box in the middle of the trolley, then Bingo into the trolley’s child seat.

Bluey: Ooh Bingo! These can be our houses!

Bingo: Yeah! (gestures to the half of the trolley in front of her) This is my yard (points to the half in front of Bluey) and that’s yours!

Bluey: Yeah!

The scene transitions to Chilli pushing the trolley through the garden center, humming the main theme. She stops and hands a potted plant and a small succulent to Bluey to set in her half of the trolley.

Bluey: Ooh! Hey, Bingo. Look, I’ve got a garden!

The camera zooms out to show that two identical plants are in Bingo’s half as well.

Bingo: Yeah, me too!

Chilli is returning with a garden gnome dog holding a shovel, setting it in front of Bingo.

Chilli: Can’t have too many of these.

Bingo: Ooh, you could be my husband.

Bingo hugs the gnome and pats its head affectionately as Bluey peeks over the barricade.

Bluey: Hey, no fair! I want a husband, too.

Chilli begrudgingly hands another gnome, this one without a shovel, to Bluey.

Chilli: Yes, yes. Here you go. Same as Bingo.

Bluey: (giggles) Hello, husband.

Bingo: (exaggerated masculine voice to voice her gnome “husband”) Hello. My name is Hecuba.

Bluey: (similar masculine voice to voice her “husband”) Ooh, hello, Hecuba. My name’s Gerald.

Bingo: (pointing out “Hecuba”’s shovel, voice as “Hecuba”) I’m going to do some yard work. (normal voice as she moves the gnome around) Dig, dig, dig. Dig, dig, dig, dig. Dig, did, dig, dig.

Bluey looks over at “Gerald”.

Bluey: Hey, Gerald doesn’t have a shovel. Mum, Bingo’s husband is better than mine! (points at “Hecuba”)

Chilli: Just try and be happy with what you’ve got, okay?

Bluey: I can’t be happy with what I’ve got when what she has is better!

Bluey hands “Gerald” over to Chilli, who returns him to the shelf in exchange for a gnome with a shovel. She hands it to Bluey.

Chilli: Here.

Bluey: Thanks, Mum. Hello, new husband.

The scene transitions to another aisle as Chilli pushes the trolley. Bingo is humming.

Bingo: What a lovely veggie patch, Hecuba.

Chilli sets a small box of fairy lights in Bingo’s “yard”.

Chilli: Fairy lights.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bluey: Hey, why does Bingo-

Chilli sets another box into Bluey’s “yard”.

Chilli: And more fairy lights that are just the same.

Bluey: Thank you. These can be our pizza ovens.

Bluey and Bingo hold out their fists as if holding pan handles, shifting them to cook imaginary pizza.

Bluey and Bingo: Cook, cook, cook, cook. Cook, cook.

Chilli sets a pizza cutter with a protector around the blade into Bingo’s “yard”.

Bingo: (grabs the pizza cutter) Oh look, Hecuba, a pizza flipper. (shifts the “flipper” around) Cook, cook, cook. (raises the “flipper”) Flip. (repeats motions) Cook, cook, cook. Flip.

As Bingo continues, the camera zooms out to Chilli checking the price tag of a metal spatula.

Bluey: Mum, can we get two pizza flippers, please?

Chilli: We don’t need two. Try swapping something with Bingo.

Bingo: Cook, cook, cook. (stops when Bluey addresses her)

Bluey: (holds up her small succulent) Bingo, will you swap some of my plants for your pizza flipper?

Bingo: (holds the “flipper” defensively) No thanks. (raises “flipper”) Flip!

Bluey: (picks up “Gerald”) What about for my husband?

Bingo: No thanks! (raises “flipper”) Flip!

Bluey: Aww, but that pizza flipper is all I want in the whole world!

Bingo: (whining) Okay. (hands over the “flipper”)

Bluey: Thanks Bingo. (giggles, repeating Bingo’s motions) Cook, cook, cook. Flip! Cook, cook, cook. Flip!

Cut back to Chilli picking up a pizza stone from a shelf.

Chilli: Ooh, pizza stone!

Chilli sets the stone on top of Bingo’s fairy light box.

Bingo: (gasp) A dining table!

Bluey: Aww! I’ll swap you back the pizza flipper for your dining table!

Bingo: (holds the “dining table” defensively) No way!

Bluey: Bingo! (grabs the “table” and tries to pull it to her side) I want a turn with it.

Bingo: Hey! (pulls it back)

Bluey: (pulls back) Give it to me!

Bingo: (pulls) Bluey!

Bluey: (pulls) Let go of it, Bingo!

Bingo: (pulls) Give it to me, Bluey!

Bluey’s pull on the “dining table” becomes too powerful for Bingo to pull against, her grip quickly slipping off. Her elbow hits “Hecubah”, causing him to fall over the side of the trolley and shatter on the floor. Chilli gasps.

The scene cuts to Aisle 300, where Bandit is standing next to a brick pizza oven identical to Pat’s, conversing with an employee.

Bandit: So, how many BTU’s has this one got?

Chilli: (off screen, yelling distantly) Bluey!

Both Bandit and the employee flinch.

Bandit: Ehh, it’s probably another Bluey.

The scene cuts back to the previous aisle. Bluey and Bingo have been taken out of the trolley seat. Bingo appears glum.

Bluey: I’m sorry!

Chilli: (pointing out the shattered “Hecubah”) This is what happens when you’re unhappy with what you’ve got. (makes a chopping motion into her palm) Someone’s husband eventually gets it!

Bluey: I just wanted the dining room table.

Chilli: (kneels down to Bluey’s level) You can’t just get new stuff all the time.

Bluey: Why not?

Chilli: Because stuff costs money. There’s no magical place where everything’s just free.

Bingo: (pointing off screen) Bluey, look!

The scene transitions to Bingo and Bluey excitedly facing a colorful row of paint samples. The music briefly changes to the tune of Handel’s “Hallelujah” chorus.

Bingo: It’s everything we want!

Chilli approaches as Bluey excitedly points out the samples.

Bluey: Are these all for free?

Chilli: Yes, they’re all for free.

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

The scene transitions to Bluey and Bingo in the trolley, decorated with paint samples. Bluey’s “yard” has a green field, while Bingo’s is yellow. Each has a patch of blue bordered by orange to represent pools. Bluey has formed a pizza with some samples with some pieces shredded as toppings on top of her fairy light box. She continues to shred a black-colored square. Bingo is stacking a few colors into a hamburger on top of her “dining table”.

Bluey: (exaggerated posh voice) Hmm, Gerald, I’ll put olives on your half, my dear. (sprinkles her black shreddings on part of the “pizza”, turns to Bingo) Sharralanda, darling, you wouldn’t have some lettuce I could borrow, would you?

Bingo: (posh voice) Of course, Rhonda. (picks up some green shreddings and hands to Bluey)

Bluey: Thanks, darling. (sprinkles the “lettuce” onto the “pizza”)

Bingo: (picks up her “hamburger”) I’m just enjoying this hamburger. Poor Hecuba. He always loved hamburgers.

Bluey: Would you like to try some beetroot? (picks up hot pink shreddings)

Bingo: Oh, thank you, darling. (puts the “beetroot” under the top layer of her “burger”)

Bluey: Isn’t it nice having everything?

Bingo: Yes, it is.

Chilli: Just try not to get used to it, okay?

Bluey: Oh, it’s that lady who said we can’t have everything we want!

Bingo: Don’t listen to her, Rhonda!

The scene cuts to later down the aisle. The trolley has stopped and a distant beeping can be heard.

Bluey: Oh, that pizza was delicious. (returns to her normal voice) Hey, why have we stopped?

Bingo: (normal voice) And what’s that dooting?

The checkout lady takes the succulent from Bingo’s “yard” as Chilli takes both plants from Bluey’s side.

Bingo: Hey!

Bluey: Aah! My plants! What are you doing?

The camera shifts to show the checkout lady scanning the succulent from Bingo’s “yard”.

Checkout Lady: Hi guys! I have to scan all your stuff, okay?

Bingo gasps.

Bluey and Bingo: We’re at the checkout!

Chilli takes the fairy lights box from Bluey’s side, causing the scraps of “pizza” to flutter off.

Bluey: Aah! My pizza oven! Give it back!

The “hamburger” falls apart as the checkout lady tries to take the pizza stone from Bingo, who is trying her hardest to tug it back. Bluey holds “Gerald” defensively.

Bingo: No! Don’t take my dining table!

Bingo loses the tug of war for her “dining table”.

Chilli: We have to pay for it!

The checkout lady takes “Gerald” from Bluey’s arms. She tries to reach out for him.

Bluey: Gerald!

Chilli: Bluey, relax!

Bluey: (squirming in her seat) She’s taking my husband!

The checkout lady hesitatingly scans the garden gnome as the camera zooms out to show Bandit, carrying the box for the pizza oven on a flatbed cart.

Bandit: Uh, I might meet you in the car.

He pushes his cart away. The scene transitions to show the screen at the register with items gradually appearing, the beeping heard in the background. The shot then cuts to the Heelers, sans Bandit. Bluey and Bingo, dejected, are holding small boxes with their paint sample scraps, while Chilli holds a bigger box with the plants and the pizza stone in it.

Bluey: We worked so hard on our houses.

Bingo: I wasn’t ready to take them down.

Chilli: I know. I guess nothing lasts forever.

The scene cuts back to the checkout lady, holding her handheld scanner and four boxes of lightbulbs.

Checkout Lady: Hey, would you kids like to try my beeper gun?

Bluey: (sets down her box) Yes, please!

Checkout Lady: (kneels to Bluey’s level and hands her the scanner) Here you go!

The lady holds out one of the boxes for Bluey to scan. She squeals and giggles as she scans it, plus a second box.

Bingo: (touches Bluey’s shoulder) Can I have a turn?

Bluey: (hands her the scanner) Yeah. Here you go.

Bingo squeals and laughs as she, holding the scanner with both hands, scans the last two boxes.

The scene fades to later in the evening. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are sitting at a picnic table as Bandit retrieves a pizza from the newly set up pizza oven.

Bandit: Okay, kids, are you ready for the best pizza you’ve ever tasted!

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Chilli: We’ll see about that.

Bandit: Ta-da!

Bandit sets a pizza stone with a puffy and lopsided pizza on top down on the table. The camera briefly zooms in on it to show that the cheese is oozing off of it, the toppings are falling off, and parts of it are slightly burnt. A piece of ham flops over during the zoom in. The scene zooms back out.

Bandit: Looks a bit bodgy.

Chilli: (sets a hand on Bandit’s shoulder) No. It’s just got character.

Bandit ruffles the top of Bluey’s head as each Heeler grabs a slice. Bingo’s is noticeably bigger than Bluey’s.

Bandit: Tuck in, kids. I’m just gonna give one to Lucky’s dad.

Bandit heads over to the fence as Bingo eats a loose piece of ham off of her slice.

Bluey: Hey! Yours is bigger than mine. But, that’s fine.

Chilli smiles at Bluey. The scene cuts to Bandit approaching Pat at the fence with a slice of pizza in hand.

Bandit: Hey, mate, have a go at this. Ham and pineapple.

Bandit hands his slice over to Pat.

Pat: Aw, yeah. Swap you for a meat lover’s.

Pat passes a much thinner slice of pizza back over the fence.

Bandit: Nice!

Chilli: (off screen, mouth full) Oh, my goodness.

The scene cuts back to the other Heelers at the picnic table. Chilli is chewing her slice with a smile.

Bluey and Bingo: What is it?

Chilli: (swallows) This is amazing!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

The scene cuts back to Bandit and Pat at the fence, silently exchanging a high-five.

[End credits]

During the end credits, the episode’s soundtrack plays as Winton's dad walks on screen with a sauce-covered sausage in each hand. He finishes the one in his left hand in three bites, a few seconds apart.

[Theme Song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. Bluey is humming to herself as she sits in the playroom with her toy Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Today, Polly, the cousins are coming over. Mum and Aunt Trixie are gonna play hockey. (whisper) That means we can play horsey with Dad and Uncle Stripe. (holds up Polly) Is that gonna be fun? (as Polly) Yeah, I think so. (as herself) Oh, good Polly Puppy.

She hugs Polly. The doorbell rings.

Muffin: (offscreen, distantly yelling past the door) Bluey!

The doorbell keeps being rung repeatedly.

Bluey: They're here!

Bluey runs to the door, Polly Puppy still in hand, giggling. She only manages to open the door a small crack before Chilli pushes it back shut with her field hockey stick. The doorbell is still being rung. Although muffled, Muffin yelling "Bluey! Open the door!" and Socks howling can be heard.

Chilli: Bluey, last time the cousins visited, you got upset because they spilled passionfruit all over Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Oh yeah, I better put her away.

Chilli: 'Cause she's your special puppy.

Bluey: Yes, I'll put her in my room.

Bluey runs towards the stairs as Bandit and Bingo approach.

Bandit: Oh, there's my watermelon!

Bandit picks up Bluey, holding her horizontally as he pretends to nibble her stomach. Bluey screams as Polly Puppy flies out of her hands and lands on the floor.

Bandit: Nom nom nom nom!

The camera briefly zooms in on the abandoned Polly Puppy before transitioning back to the entry hall as Bandit sets Bluey back to the ground. Stripe, Muffin, and Trixie carrying Socks have now entered. Muffin is wearing thongs/sandals.

Trixie: G'day, Bingo. G'day, Bluey. Hello, Bandit.

Bluey and Bingo: Hi.

Stripe: (playfully pointing finger guns) Hey kids, how're ya goin'? (waves to Bandit) Hey brother.

Bandit: (waves back) Hey.

Trixie: (looks down at Muffin) Ooh, show Aunt Chilli your thongs, Muffin.

Muffin: Aunt Chilli, I'm wearing thongs! (raises her left foot and points to it)

Chilli: Oh, great! Hello, Socks.

Chilli reaches a finger towards Socks, who, growling, nips at it. Chilli recoils with a yelp as Socks, yipping, squirms out of Trixie's arms and runs off. Still barking, she stops near the stairwell where she find the dropped Polly Puppy toy, jumping on and starting to chew on it.

The scene switches back to the entry hall as Trixie and Chilli are leaving the house.

Chilli: Okay kids, Aunt Trix and I are off to play hockey. Have fun with Dad and Uncle Stripe.

Muffin and Bingo look back smiling as the two dads start to look concerned. Their attention is drawn back as all three kids return Trixie and Chilli's wave.

Trixie: See ya, kids. (muttered under her breath to Chilli) Quick, let's get out of here.

Bluey and Bandit: Bye!

Stripe: (in sync with Bluey and Bandit) See ya!

Bingo: See ya later!

As Trixie and Chilli leave, Bandit kneels down to the girls' level.

Bandit: All right, girls, who wants to sit on the couch and watch cricket?!

Bluey: (shouting) Noooo!

Bingo and Muffin: Not me!

Muffin: No way!

Bluey: Let's play horsey ride!

All kids: Yeah!

As the kids run off giggling, Bandit and Stripe sigh defeatedly.

Stripe: Well, we gave it a shot.

TITLE CARD - Polly Puppy, surrounded by some flower petals and stuffing and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Horsey Ride!

The scene transitions to the backyard, where Bluey is leading Stripe and Bandit, who are crawling along the ground on all fours, by a jump rope they are holding in their mouths. Muffin is riding on top of Stripe and Bingo is on top of Bandit. Both riders are giggling.

Bluey: Giddyup, Sparkles! (waves the jump rope)

Stripe, playing "Sparkles", neighs.

Bluey: Giddyup, Gallahop! (waves the jump rope again)

Bandit, playing "Gallahop", neighs, snorts, and clicks his tongue. The two "horses" stop right before the steps to the tiled patio. "Sparkles" neighs again and "Gallahop" lets out a nicker.

Bluey: (waves the jump rope again) Come on, horsies. Giddyup! (another wave of the rope)

"Sparkles" and "Gallahop" both nicker in protest.

Muffin: (kicks "Sparkles"'s side) When I do this, it means giddyup!

All kids: Giddyup!

Both "horses" nicker in protest as Bluey leads them up the stairs. As they walk along the patio, they break character with pained grunts.

Bluey: Horsies love tiles.

The "horses" stop.

Muffin: (patting "Sparkles"'s head) Sparkles needs more sparkles on her.

Bluey: Ooh, I'll get some glitter. (drops the jump rope and runs off)

"Sparkles" neighs in distress as "Gallahop" gives a laughing neigh at "her" misfortune.

The scene transitions back to the playroom, where Socks is still growling and gnawing on Polly Puppy as Bluey runs in.

Bluey: (screaming) Aaaah! Polly Puppy!

The scene cuts back to the yard. Bingo and Muffin have dismounted, sitting back and watching as the "horses" butt heads with each other, whinnying.

Bluey: (crying out from off screen) Daaaad!

Cut back to the playroom as Bluey is trying to tug Polly Puppy away from Socks.

Bluey: Let go, Socks!

The rest of the Heelers enter. Bandit and Stripe are standing upright again.

Bandit: Hey, hey. Okay, chill the beans, everyone.

Bluey loses the tug of war, letting go of Polly as Socks continues to chew.

Bluey: (points accusingly at Socks) Socks won't let go of Polly Puppy! (stomps her foot)

Muffin: Socks, let Polly go. It's Bluey's special toy!

Stripe: Let me try. (kneels down to Sock's level as she growls) Hey there, Rocksocks, how about we-

As Stripe tries to reach for Polly, Socks nips at him. He recoils.

Stripe: Ow! (shrugs and steps back) Well, I'm out of ideas.

Muffin: I put all my special toys away when my cousins come over. You should've done that, Bluey.

Bandit: Good idea, Muffin.

Bluey: I was going to do that, but then you ate me like a watermelon and I got distracted.

Bandit has a concerned look of realization as Stripe glares at him.

Bandit: No point playing the blame game. We need a solution.

Bluey: Something for Socks that's even more fun than Polly Puppy.

Bingo: What about a horsey ride?

Muffin: Or two horsey rides?

Bluey: What if we had a horsey wedding?

All kids, sans Socks: Yee!

Bluey: Sparkles can marry Gallahop!

Bandit: Huh?

Bingo: And we could make confetti.

Bandit: What?

Muffin: And invite Socks!

Stripe: What was that?

All kids, sans Socks: Yeah!

Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin join hands in a circle, chanting "Horsey Wedding!"

Stripe: Aw, man...

The scene transitions to the backyard where the wedding venue has been set up. Six white chairs are set up, three on each side, on either side of a long argyle rug. Five out of six chairs are taken by stuffed animals and one in the front row is left open. The center rug "aisle" leads up to a smaller zigzag patterned rug. Bluey is sitting on a stool in front of a toy keyboard. Bingo, wearing a heart bopper headband is standing by an open cookbook. Bandit is back in horse position as "Gallahop", wearing a purple top hat and a red bow tie. Bluey presses a star-shaped button as the keyboard plays a basic upbeat tune, the two sisters bobbing their heads to it.

Bluey: (into the toy microphone on the keyboard, with some feedback) Socks! We'd like to invite you to the wedding of Sparkles and Gallahop!

Socks stops gnawing on Polly Puppy, looking up curious, before returning to what she was doing.

Bluey: Hmm. Bring out Sparkles!

Bluey presses the star button again, the keyboard now playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March". Stripe, on all fours as "Sparkles", is now covered in more glitter and is wearing a fluffy flowered heaband with a see-through veil dangling behind him. Muffin leads him along the rug "aisle", tossing a bunch of petals in the air. "Gallahop" smiles as "Sparkles" stops by his side and Muffin takes a seat.

Bandit: I'm the luckiest horse in the world.

Muffin: Horsies can't talk.

Bingo: (clears her throat) Ladies and gentlemen, may Sparkles marry Gallahop today.

Muffin claps.

Bluey: (through the microphone) Socks! The wedding has started!

Cut back briefly to Socks still snarling and chewing on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: It's not working. Get them to say some things.

Bluey presses the star button to stop the music.

Bingo: You may now say some things.

Stripe: Uh... I'm not marrying him. He stinks.

Bandit: (gasps and fake sobs) My heart is breaking.

Muffin: I said, horsies can't talk!

Bandit: Oh, I mean... (neighs sadly)

Bluey: Let them get married!

Bingo: You may now get married.

"Sparkles" neighs in protest. Muffin gets up from her seat.

Muffin: She said, you now get married!

Bluey: (through the mic) You have to say "I do!"

Muffin: Yeah, but in horsey talk!

All three kids glaring at the couple, Bluey presses the star button again, cuing a drumroll. "Gallahop" nickers at "Sparkles" with a flirtatious look, causing "Sparkles" to buck up and neigh in panic. The three kids scream, Bluey falling off her stool and knocking down the keyboard, as "Sparkles" turns and runs the other way, knocking over chairs along the way.

Bingo: Sparkles!

Bluey: No! (gets up and runs after "Sparkles") Come back, Sparkles! You have to do it properly!

Bingo and Muffin join the chase as "Gallahop" is left behind letting out a sobbing whinny. "Sparkles" runs into the house whinnying, causing Socks to stop chewing on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Come back, Sparkles!

Muffin: Marry Gallahop!

Bingo: Now!

The scene transitions to the kitchen. "Sparkles" ducks behind the counter as the girls run past.

Bluey: I want Polly back.

"Sparkles" peeks back up over the counter, letting out a soft sigh of relief as he heads off in the other direction. The scene transitions to the girls running into Bandit and Chilli's room.

Bluey: Where'd he go?

The girls pause as they hear chattering from the television in the distance. The scene transitions to the living room where "Sparkles" is contentedly watching a cricket match on the TV before Bluey bursts in.

Bluey: He's watching the cricket! Get him!

The girls chase "Sparkles" out of the room and into the playroom. He encounters Socks, who, releasing Polly Puppy, begins to bark and growl att at him aggressively. "Sparkles" bucks up defensively, neighing. After a loud bark from Socks, "Sparkles" backs down, whimpering, giving Bingo and Muffin a chance to tackle him, laughing. Socks hops up and down excitedly.

Muffin and Bingo: Good one, Socks!

Bluey tiptoes past towards Polly Puppy, hugging her in her arms. Stripe and Bluey wink at each other. Socks is now on top of the heap, howling. The scene transitions back to the backyard wedding.

Bandit: (fake sobs) I'd been looking forward to this day all my life and now it's ruined.

Socks is barking and growling, leading a very scared "Sparkles" back to "Gallahop" before panting excitedly. The rest of the girls return to their positions at the wedding. "Gallahop" glares at his bride. "Sparkles" neighs in apology, but "Gallahop" only scoffs. Bluey presses the button on her keyboard to restart the drumroll.

Bingo: You may now say "I do."

"Sparkles" and "Gallahop" exchange nervous glances as the drumroll stops.

The scene transitions to Chilli and Trixie re-entering the house.

Trixie: Well, I guess that's why we wear mouth guards.

As Chilli sets down her bag, the girls are heard squealing excited in the background as "Wedding March" plays again.

Trixie: Well, that sounds positive.

The rest of the Heelers re-enter the foyer, Bluey carrying Polly Puppy. Stripe dusts himself off as Bingo and Muffin hug Chilli and Trixie respectively.

Chilli: What have you kids been up to?

Bandit: Oh, you know, just regular childhood games.

Bingo: Uncle Stripe married Dad!

Bluey: Yeah!

Trixie: Oh, really?

Chilli and Trixie laugh, as Socks howls and the rest of the girls resume their earlier "Horsey Wedding!" chant with joined hands.

Bandit: (shrugs) Well, who could blame him?

Stripe simply shakes his head.

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - an up-tempo, percussion-heavy tune. Bluey is dancing.

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. In the kitchen, Bandit is playing "Mountain Climber" with Bingo.

Bandit: Here comes the mountain climber! Is she gonna (grunts) get to the top? (grunts again) She made it!

Bingo: I made it!

Bluey walks in.

Bandit: Uh-oh, it's getting windy!

Bingo laughs as Bandit moves around.

Bandit: It's getting windy!

Bluey: Look out, Bingo!

Bandit lets Bingo down to the ground.

Bandit: Oh, she's fallen down! (groans)

Bingo: Again, again!

Bluey: Do that to me!

Bandit: Oh, man. Is there some game where I just lie really still on a comfy bed or something?

Bluey and Bingo look at each other.

Bluey and Bingo: Hospitals!

Bandit: Oh, not hospital.

TITLE CARD - a stuffed cat, a stuffed mouse, and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Hospital.

In the playroom, Bingo leads Bandit to a bed made of two couch pillows.

Bingo: Please lie here.

Bandit: Thanks, Doctor.

Bingo: No, I'm the nurse.

Bandit: Oh, sorry. Thanks, Nurse. My name is Telemachus.

Bingo picks up a remote control.

Bingo: This remote control makes the bed go up and down, Telemachus.

Bandit: Oh, great!

Bingo: This one makes the legs go up...

Bingo vocalises the sounds of the remote and bed as Bandit's head pillow is pushed up.

Bandit: Ah!

Bingo: Oops, wrong button. Sorry, dear.

Bingo vocalises the sounds of the remote and bed as Bandit's head pillow goes back down, his leg pillow goes up, and then goes back down.

Bandit: Uh! Ah! Oh!

Bingo puts a thermometer in Bandit's mouth.

Bingo: Now don't worry, we're going to make you feel all better.

Bandit: Oh, good. I'm actually a bit nervous at hospitals.

Bingo: There's no need to be nervous.

Suddenly, Bluey is revealed to be standing right next to Bandit.

Bluey: Hello!

Bingo and Bandit: Aah!

Bluey: I'm the doctor!

Bandit: Oh, hello, Doctor. My name is--

Bluey pricks Bandit with a needle (actually a wooden block).

Bluey: Sting!

Bandit: Ouch!

Bingo applies a Band-Aid to the wound consolingly, then moves to gently pat Bandit.

Bingo: Oh, brave boy.

Bandit: What was that??

Bluey: A needle. Now, what seems to be the matter?

Bandit: Why did you give me a needle before asking me what's the matter?

Bluey: Because I'm very busy. Now, what's up?

Bandit: Well, my belly hurts.

Bluey pulls out a stethoscope and listens to Bandit's belly.

Bluey: Have you got a baby in there?

Bandit: No, I don't think so.

Bluey: Nurse, do an X-ray on the big blue guy, please. I think there's a baby in there.

Bingo: Yes, Doctor.

Bingo runs off to get the X-ray machine.

Bandit: Hang on, I really don't think I have a--

Bluey pricks Bandit with another needle.

Bluey: Sting!

Bandit: Ouch!

Bluey: Bye!

Bluey leaves, and Bingo walks back in with a shoebox.

Bandit: Good grief! She certainly likes those needles.

Bingo: Don't worry, sweetie. It's all to make you feel better. Now, time for your X-ray. Ready?

Bandit nods as Bingo prepares to use the shoebox as an X-ray machine on his belly.

Bingo: Three, two, one. (grunts) X-ray!

She runs to draw up an X-ray on paper.

Bingo: X-ray'll be ready in a jiffy!

Bandit: Ah, good. I'll just relax...

Bluey runs back in with the needle at the ready.

Bluey: I'm back! Sting!

She pricks Bandit again.

Bandit: Yow! Bluey! I mean, Doctor. Can that be the last injection, please?

Bluey: Nope.

Bingo walks over with the completed X-ray.

Bingo: Here's the X-ray, Doctor.

Bluey: Oh, thank you. I'll just get this plaster off.

Bandit: Huh?

Bluey rips off the Band-aid.

Bluey: Rip!

Bandit: Ow!

Bingo [consolingly]: Brave boy.

Bingo pats Bandit's head as Bluey takes the X-ray and holds it up.

Bluey: Oh, well this does not look good. You see just here?

Bluey points at the X-ray, where Bingo has drawn a cat inside Bandit.

Bandit: Oh, look. It's a... possum?

Bluey: Yes. You have a possum in your belly.

Bingo: That's not a possum. It's a cat.

Bluey: Oh yeah. You have a cat in your belly.

Bandit: How did it get in there?

Bingo: Did you eat one?

Bandit: No!

Bluey throws the X-ray aside.

Bluey: Well, no one really knows how cats get in your belly, but probably through your belly button?

Bandit: What? Really?

Bluey: Yeah. Probably, they just set up a slide while you're asleep, and just slide right in, you know?

Bandit: My goodness.

Bluey: We'll have to operate.

Bingo: Yes, Doctor.

Bluey and Bingo run to Bandit's other side. Bluey pulls out an egg beater and starts cranking it.

Bandit: Woah, hang on.

Bluey: Let's do this. Here's a magazine to read.

She throws a magazine on Bandit's face. He grunts and removes it.

Bandit: You mean you're not even going to put me to sleep first?

Bluey: Oh, yeah. I guess we could. Nurse, can you put this big blue guy to sleep, please?

Bingo: Yes, Doctor.

Bingo puts a sleep mask over Bandit's mouth and sings as Bandit yawns and falls asleep.

Bingo [sung]: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, big Telemachus...

Bandit snores.

Bingo: He's asleep!

Bluey: Oh, good, I can give him another needle! Sting!

She pricks Bandit again, who is suddenly not sleeping.

Bandit: OW! Bluey!

Bluey: You're meant to be asleep!

Bandit: No. More. Needles!

Bluey: Fine.

Bingo [sung]: Go to sleep, go to sleep...

Bandit falls asleep again.

Bingo [whisper]: He's asleep.

Bluey: Ok, let's go!

Bluey runs the egg beater over Bandit's belly, making whirring sounds as she does.

Bandit: Oh! Oh! Ow!

Bluey: Now, let's get this cat out!

She reaches her hand "into" Bandit. Something squeaks.

Bluey: Oh, I think I got it! (grunts) Here, kitty! Ah!

Bluey pulls out a squeaky stuffed octopus, and quickly begins to struggle with it.

Bingo: Ah! That's not a cat! That's an octopus! Put it back in! I think it's supposed to be in there!

Bluey attempts to shove the octopus back in.

Bluey: Get back in, octopus! So many tentacles!

Bingo: Doctor, catch!

Bingo throws Bluey the remote. Bluey then uses it to pound the octopus back in as it squeaks. Bandit grunts form this.

Bluey: Get. Back. In!

The remote falls in with the octopus.

Bluey: Aah! Bingo! It's got the remote! Let go!

Bandit's bed begins to go haywire, lifting his head and legs at random. The stuffed octopus is still squeaking.

Bandit: Woah!

Bluey: Hey! Let go! Hey, I see that cat! I see the cat! Nurse, give me something to whack it with.

Bingo: Ok.

Bingo hands Bluey an inflatable hammer, which she uses to pound even harder, causing more squeaking from the octopus and more grunting from Bandit Bingo comes over and shines a torch, helping Bluey see.

Bluey: Oh, I've got his tail!

Bingo: Pull it!

Bluey groans, then screams.

Bingo: What happened?

Bluey: It bit me!

Bingo: Oh, you poor dear!

Bingo puts a Band-Aid on Bluey's hand.

Bluey: That cat's not going anywhere!

Bingo: Oh, my.

Bluey: Better wake the big blue guy and tell him.

Bingo: You mean... we can't make him feel all better?

Bluey: No. Wake up, mate!

Bluey snaps the sleep mask against Bandit's face.

Bandit: OW! Bluey!

Bluey: Doctor Bluey.

Bandit: Is the operation finished?

Bluey: Yeah. Sorry. There's nothing we can do. That cat just won't come out.

Bandit: Oh. I see.

Bluey: Now, I've got other patients. You're on your own.

Bandit: What?

Bluey: See ya!

Bluey leaves, and Bingo walks to Bandit's other side to comfort him.

Bandit: Oh, I thought I was going to feel all better.

Bingo: I'm sorry.

Bandit: That's Ok. You tried your best.

Bingo looks around sadly.

Bingo: Hm...

She brightens.

Bingo: Leave it with me.

Bandit: Ok, Nurse.

Bingo goes to add to the X-ray. Over in another part of the playroom, Bluey is examining a stuffed fox with her stethoscope.

Bluey: Those prickles will have to come out, I'm afraid.

Bingo enters with a new drawing.

Bingo: Excuse me, Doctor...

Bluey: I'm very busy, Nurse.

Bingo: I know, but can you look at this X-ray again?

Bluey: If it's from the big blue guy, there's really nothing I can do.

Bingo: Just check it a bit closer.

Bluey: Fine.

Bluey takes the X-ray and examines it as Bingo smiles excitedly.

Bluey: (gasps) Wait a minute! I didn't see this before!

Back in the other part of the playroom, Bandit yawns and relaxes on his bed. Bluey walks over, startling Bandit.

Bluey: Hello, big blue guy.

Bingo: His name's Telemachus.

Bluey: Something else has turned up on your X-ray, Telemachus.

Bandit: Really?

Bluey: Look, here.

Bluey points at the X-ray, where Bingo has added a mouse inside Bandit.

Bandit: Oh, it's a... pot plant?

Bingo: No, it's a mouse.

Bandit: Ah. Of course. A mouse.

Bluey: I think you swallowed a mouse.

Bingo: And then the cat ran in after it!

Bluey: Because cats chase mice!

Bandit: Oh, goodness. What are you going to do?

Bluey: Hmm... What if we lured the mouse out?

Bingo: With some cheese!

Bluey: Then the cat would chase the mouse!

Bandit: Right out of my belly!

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Cut to cheese being hung like bait from a fishing rod by a laughing Bingo as Bluey holds Bandit's mouth open.

Bluey: A little bit lower... a little bit lower...

Bluey reaches down and pulls out a stuffed mouse.

Bluey: There's the mouse!

She pulls out a stuffed cat.

Bluey: Rawr! And there's the cat!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Bingo goes to take the cat and Bluey walks around Bandit.

Bingo: Oh, good kitty.

Bluey: How do you feel?

Bandit: Hmm... I feel all better!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Bandit: Thanks, Doctor. And thank you, Nurse.

Bingo pats Bandit's head.

Bingo: You're welcome.

Bandit: Well, if that's that, I guess I'll be on my way.

Bandit stretches and gets up.

Bluey: Oh, one more thing.

Bandit: What's that?

Bluey pricks Bandit with the needle yet again.

Bluey: Sting!

Bandit: Ow!

The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo hiding underneath a bedsheet, Bingo giggling.

Bluey: Shhh!

From off, a door opens.

Chilli [from off]: Bandit, I'm just having a quick shower, then I'll give you a hand cleaning the room.

Bandit [from off]: All good, I've got it covered.

The door closes and the shower starts running.

Bandit [from off]: Now, where are those naughty kids?

Bingo giggles again. Suddenly, Bandit pulls the sheet off.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Bandit: Oh, whoa, here they are!

Bluey: Do that again!

Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit puts the sheet over his kids and removes it repeatedly.

Bandit: Kids, no kids. Kids, no kids. Kids, no kids.

Bluey: Let's play hotels!

Bingo: Yeah!

Bandit: Oh no, not hotels.

TITLE CARD - a cloud bag and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Hotel.

Bluey cuts out paper squares and Bingo writes numbers on them before sticking them on doors. Bluey removes the washing from a washing basket and places is upside-down at the top of the stairs. Bingo stands next to her. Bandit then walks up the stairs with a cloud bag, whistling.

Bluey: Oh, Bingo, we have a guest!

Bingo: I want to be a crazy pillow!

Bluey: No, you're the crazy hotel helper.

Bingo: Aw...

Bandit arrives at the top of the stairs.

Bandit: Hello!

Bluey: No, Dad, you have to push the bell.

Bandit: Oh, ok.

Bandit presses the top of Bingo's head.

Bingo: DIIIING!!

Bluey and Bandit recoil.

Bandit: Ahhh!! I might just fix that bell's volume.

Bandit "fixes" Bingo.

Bandit: There. Let's try again.

Bandit again presses the top of Bingo's head.

Bingo: Ding!

Bandit: That's better.

Bluey: Hello, how are you? We are very nice.

Bandit: I'm good. I'd like a room, please.

Bluey: Oh yes, we have some rooms.

Bandit: One with a TV.

Bluey: Oh yes, sure. This way, please.

Bluey indicates behind her. Bandit walks in that direction.

Bandit: Thank you!

Bluey: Bingo, grab his suitcase.

Bingo: No, my name is Slobberdobber.

Bluey: Oh yes. Grab his suitcase, Slobberdobber.

Cut to Bluey leading Bandit through the halls. The doors have consecutive numbers stuck to them. Bingo is slowly falling behind, dragging the cloud bag behind her.

Bandit: I have an important cleaning job to do in the morning, so it's very important that I am not disturbed.

Bluey: Oh, of course.

Bluey opens the door on the kids' room.

Bluey: We have this lovely room. It has the sleepy bunny night-light and some toys.

Bandit: Hmm, no thanks.

Bluey and Bandit leave the kids' room and enter the study.

Bluey: We also have this room.

Bandit: Hmm, maybe too many computers and not enough beds.

Bluey and Bandit leave that room and come to a door labelled "6".

Bluey: And we have this room.

She opens the door to reveal Bingo sitting on the toilet with the cloud bag.

Bingo: Hey! Do you mind?

Bluey giggles.

Bandit: Oh, no. Too stinky.

Bluey leads Bandit into the parents' room.

Bluey: And this is the big room. It has a bed, and a TV. Oh, and there's a lady in the shower. Is that ok?

Bandit tests the bed before getting into it.

Bandit: This will do nicely. Goodnight!

Bandit pretends to fall asleep and snore, but quickly stops.

Bandit: Hmm. This pillow isn't very comfy.

Bluey: Yes it is.

Bandit: Oh, ok.

He returns to his snoring. Bluey quietly goes to leave, but Bingo suddenly and loudly enters, waking Bandit up.

Bingo: Yarp! Yarp! Yarp!

Bluey: Crazy helper!

Bluey picks up Bingo, covering her mouth as she carries her out of the room with the cloud bag lying on the ground.

Bluey: Ok, see you in the morning, sir.

Bandit: Yes, please see that I am not disturbed until then.

Bluey: Oh, of course. My helper won't be crazy at all.

Bandit: Oh, I'm sure she won't.

Suddenly, Bingo runs back in.

Bingo: Yaaarp!

Bluey runs in after her and covers her mouth again, closing the door quietly. Bandit continues to "sleep" for a bit, until Bingo again bursts in - this time with a party horn and a broom.

Bingo: (blows horn) Me tidy room now!

Bandit: What?

Bingo pulls the sheet of Bandit's bed.

Bingo: Ya ya ya, yaaaaaa!

Bingo continues yelling and brandishing her broom as Bluey calmly walks in.

Bluey: Oh, Slobberdobber! I am terribly sorry about this, sir.

Bandit: Well I should say so! I have a very important meeting in the morning.

Bluey picks up Bingo and again carries her out of the room.

Bingo: Do you need a crazy pillow??

Bluey: No, he doesn't.

Bingo continues yelling as she's carried out.

Bluey: This is very embarrassing. It won't happen again.

Bandit: Well please see that it doesn't.

Bluey leaves the room and closes the door, leaving Bandit alone. He goes to sleep again but Bingo immediately returns, banging a wooden spoon against a cooking pot.

Bingo: Breakfast time!

Bandit: Who, wha..? What?

Bingo: (walking up to Bandit) Breakfast time! Who wants bacon?!

Bandit: But it's the middle of the night!

Bingo: Who wants night bacon?!!

Bluey runs back in.

Bluey: Slobberdobber! I'm so sorry, sir. This won't happen again.

Bingo: Supper!!

Bluey puts Bingo away from Bandit.

Bandit: Well, night bacon does sound pretty good, actually. As long as I'm up, I might as well watch the news.

Bluey: Yeah, the news!

Bluey runs to the foot of the bed. Bingo follows sadly.

Bingo: Bluey, can I be crazy pillow now?

Bluey: Come on, Bingo.

Bingo groans as assumes her place at the foot of the bed.

Bluey: Try the TV again!

Bandit: (miming a TV remote) Ok. Click!

A news theme starts playing as Bingo pops up at the foot of the bas as a TV presenter.

Bingo: Oh, hello. I am the TV. Today on the news...

Bluey pops up next to her.

Bluey: A wild storm keeps banging people's heads into the bed!

Bluey starts pushing Bingo's head into the bed as she giggles.

Bluey: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Bingo escapes and picks up Bluey.

Bingo: Cartoons are on!

'Bluey moves Bingo back into her original position.

Bluey: Now, back to the news. We have thunder!

Bluey starts waving Bingo from side to side as she continues giggling. Bandit looks on.

Bluey: Boom! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Bingo pushes back, stopping Bluey from moving her.

Bingo: Bluey, I want to be a crazy pillow.

Bluey: No, you're the news.

Bingo grunts in frustration. Bluey resumes waving her around.

Bluey: And lightning! Brrr, boom!

Bingo pushes Bluey away.

Bingo: No. I'm not playing. You're bossing me around.

Bingo runs out of the room angrily as Bandit looks on, worried.

Bluey: Slobberdobber, come back this instant.

Bandit: Ah, TV. Always people shouting at each other. Click!

The news music stops. Bandit gets off the bed.

Bandit: Alright, kid, I gotta get back to making the bed.

Bluey: No, Dad, wait! Don't stop! You have to keep playing! We're not finished hotels!

Bandit: Well, you better sort it out with Bingo, kiddo. You have to let her make some decisions too, you know.

Bluey: Ok.

Bluey runs out, then back in.

Bluey: Don't start tidying.

In the kids' room, Bingo is lying on her bed. Bluey runs in.

Bluey: Please, Bingo, you have to keep playing or Dad will stop playing.

Bingo: I don't wanna play anymore.

Bluey: Please?

Bingo: No!

Bluey: Please?

Bingo: No!

Bluey: Please, Bingo, I'll do anything!

Bingo: No!

Bluey looks down sadly.

Bluey: Ok...

Bluey goes to leave the room when Bingo sits up.

Bingo: Alright, I'll play.

Bluey: Really? Yeah!

Bingo: But I wanna be a crazy pillow.

Bluey: Ok.

Bingo: Yeah! Crazy pillow!

Bandit has just finished making the bed when Bluey walks back in, carrying Bingo like a pillow.

Bluey: Hello, sir. I have a new pillow here for you.

Bandit: Oh, thank you!

Bandit gets onto the bed.

Bluey: Don't worry, it's not a crazy pillow.

Bandit: Well, that's a plus.

He puts his head on Bingo like a pillow.

Bandit: My oh my, this is very comfortable and not wriggly at all. Ok, well, I best go to sleep now. Night.

He goes back to his snoring. Bingo giggles and tickles his nose. Bandit wakes up and Bingo quickly pretends to be a pillow again.

Bandit: Uh, ohh, ooh, ah! Tickly nose. Hmm, that's odd.

Bandit goes back to snoring, but Bingo giggles again and crawls away from him, waking him up.

Bandit: Hey! Pillow! Get back here!

Bluey and Bingo both start giggling. Bandit puts Bingo back as his pillow

Bandit: Now stay there, pillow. And where's my blanket? Ah, there it is!

He picks up Bluey, using her as a blanket.

Bandit: Ah, that's better.

He goes back to snoring.

Bluey: Tickle him!

Bluey and Bingo begin tickling Bandit.

Bandit: Ahh! Hey, wait a minute! (laughs) Hey, this is a crazy pillow!

Bingo: Yeah!

Bluey: And I'm a crazy blanket!

They both jump off the bed and run away from Bandit.

Bandit: Aah! Runaway bedstuff! Stop!

Bandit throws the pillows at Bluey and Bingo.

Bandit: I'll catch you with my net!

He throws the bedsheet at them, and they run out of the room.

Bandit: I'm coming to gat you! Stop!!

Bandit runs out of the room too, leaving a mess of all the previous things - the cloud bag, party horn, broom, wooden spoon, pot, pillows, and sheet. After a brief pause, Chilli exits the ensuite with a towel on her head and starts at the messy, empty scene before her.

Chilli: I thought you were gonna clean the room.

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, three hot air balloons floating in the background. In the kids' bedroom, Bluey yawns as she wakes up and hops off the bed. She steps on an almost-empty bag of balloons.

Bluey: Ooh! Morning, balloons!

The final balloon falls out of the bag.

Bluey: I mean, morning, last balloon.

Bluey begins blowing up the balloon. In the living room, Chilli is holding Bingo over the couch.

Chilli: You ready?

Bingo: Ready!

Chilli: Keep your arms up!

Bingo does so, and Chilli drops her on the couch.

Chilli: Ah!

Bingo: (giggles) Again!

Bluey walks in, holding the now-inflated balloon.

Chilli: Morning, Bluey! Oh, what have you got there?

Bluey: This is my pet bird!

Bluey lets some air out of the balloon, making a squeaking sound. Bingo giggles.

Bingo: He's saying "Good morniiiiiing!"

Chilli: Oh, good morning, pet birdie.

Bluey: Go free, birdie!

Bluey lets go of the balloon, letting it fly wildly around the room. Everyone laughs, although Chilli briefly ducks for cover. When the air runs out, the deflated balloon lands on Chilli's head. She is a bit annoyed, but smiles seeing her daughters laughing.

Chilli: Oh, that's funny, is it?

Bluey: Yeah!

Bingo: Yeah, it is!

Chilli: Well, I've got a game for you.

She starts blowing up the balloon.

Bluey [excitedly]: Is it Keepy Uppy?!

Chilli: Yeah, it's Keepy Uppy.

Bluey does a little dance.

Bluey: It's Keepy Uppy! Woo!

TITLE CARD - a falling balloon and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Keepy Uppy.

Back in the lounge room, Bingo and Bluey are standing in front of Chilli, who is holding the fully inflated balloon.

Bingo: What's Keepy Uppy?

Bluey: You have to keep the balloon in the air and can't let it touch the ground.

Bingo worriedly holds Bluey.

Bingo: What happens if it touches the ground?

Chilli: Oh, nothing, Bingo. It's just a game.

Bingo: Oh, ok.

Chilli: You ready?

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.

Chilli: Okay... go!

Chilli launches the balloon into the air and the game begins. The kids excitingly giggle and chase after it.

Bingo: Stop! Boot!

Bluey and Bingo keep giggling, "boot"ing the balloon to stop it from touching the ground.

Bluey: Boot!

Chilli runs over to the balloon.

Chilli: Boot!

Bluey: Aah, Bingo, quick!

Bingo chases the balloon across the living room.

Bingo: Yaa! Boot! (giggles)

Bluey: Boot! (giggles)

Bingo balks backwards into a pot plant to get the balloon.

Bingo: I got it, Bluey! Boot! Eee, get it!

Bluey: I got it, I got it!

Bingo: Bluey, get it!

Bluey: Yaah!

Bingo giggles. Chilli fixes up the pot plant as Bingo and Bluey continue playing.

Bluey: I got it!

Bingo: Oh, good.

Bluey: No, no, no, quick, quick!

Chilli "boot"s the balloon as it comes near her.

Chilli: Boot!

Bluey: Aah, Mum, you're making it harder!

Chilli: Ok, I'm going to cook brekkie, kids. Boot!

Bluey: Mum!

Chilli walks out, leaving Bluey and Bingo to continue playing and giggling.

Bluey: Look! What if we do small ones? Boot!

Bingo: Boot! This is so easy now.

Over in the kitchen, Chilli is making breakfast. Bluey and Bingo enter, still using small pushes to keep the balloon off the ground.

Bingo: Boot!

Bluey: Check it out, Mum! Boot!

Chilli: Hey, nice strategy balloon, girls!

Bingo: I'm a Keepy Uppy expert.

Bluey: Yep, but it's not as fun now. Can you make it hard again?

Chilli: Sorry, pickle, I've got my hands full.

Bandit enters the room with a basket full of washing.

Bandit [sung]: Oh good morning, everybody! Said good morning, everyone! Uh! [spoken] Whaddup, party people?

Bluey: Dad, we're playing Keepy Uppy. Can you make it harder?

Bandit walks over to Bingo.

Bandit: Ah, my newspaper.

Bandit grabs Bingo and holds her upside-down like a newspaper, leaving Bluey to frantically skid all over the floor to get the balloon.

Bingo: Dad!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, help!

Bingo: I can't! I'm a newspaper!

Bandit pretends to read the newspaper.

Bandit: Hmm, ah. Old so-and-so is at it again. Hmm, yes, yes...

Bluey gasps as the balloon flies out of her reach and over the counter, where it lands gently on top of a glass of orange juice.

Bluey: (gasps) Look! Wow.

Chilli turns around from the stove to see the balloon.

Chilli: Woah, look at that!

Bingo: Bluey, help!

Bluey: I'll save you, Bingo! Let her go!

Bluey tries to take Bingo out of Bandit's hands.

Bandit: Oh, you want to read the newspaper, Bluey? Ok, just don't do the sudoku.

Bandit lets Bluey have Bingo and walks over to the orange juice.

Bandit: Oh, look, lovely orange juice! Yes, please!

Bandit takes the juice, sending the balloon up and over towards the floor again. Bluey and Bingo scream.

Bluey: No, no, no! Boot!

Bingo [panting]: I'll get it!

Bluey: That's it, Bingo!

Bluey and Bingo run after the balloon, until Bandit grabs Bluey and embraces her Bluey screams and struggle, trying to get out of Bandit's grip.

Bandit: Oh, dear child. You grow up so fast.

Bluey: Ah, Dad, let go! Bingo, get it! Don't let it touch the ground!

Bingo is struggling all over the floor to stop the balloon from touching the ground.

Bingo: Bluey, help! I can't do it by myself!

Bandit: Dear child, embrace your father.

Bluey screams and pushes back against Bandit.

Bluey: Let go!

Bluey successfully gets out of Bandit's grip and starts helping Bingo.

Bluey: Boot!

Bingo: Aah, I'll get it!

Bandit [dramatically]: Oh, this heat is oppressive. I'll just turn on this fan...

Bandit activates a nearby pedestal fan, sending the balloon flying out of the kitchen. Bluey and Bingo scream.

Bluey and Bingo: Dad!

Over in the living room, Bluey and Bingo run in, chasing the balloon.

Bluey: Mine, mine!

Bandit: There's leaves everywhere!

Bandit is already there with a leaf blower. He blows the balloon out of the living room, Bluey and Bingo screaming as they run after it. In the playroom, Bluey and Bingo follow the balloon through lots of toys strewn around the room.

Bluey: There's too many toys on the ground! Boot!

Bingo: Who is responsible for this mess?

Bandit appears, lounging against the doorframe with a bowl of cereal and fruit.

Bandit: My, my, all these toys left lying around sure are making it difficult to keep the balloon up.

Bingo: We know!

Bandit: Can you imagine how easy this would be if you'd tidied them all away?

Bluey: That isn't helping!

Bingo: Oh no!

The balloon gently lands on top of a pile of blocks.

Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!

Bluey: Ha-ha, see, Dad? Our toys saved the balloon.

Bandit: Not for long!

Bandit turns on the ceiling fan, which blows the balloon off the block tower and towards the floor again.

Bluey and Bingo: No!

Bingo: You get it!

Bluey dives through the block pile to get the balloon, hitting it up.

Bluey: Yaa! (gasps)

Bluey: It's heading for the fan!

Bingo: Oh no!

The ceiling fan hits the balloon, sending it flying off. In the kitchen, Chilli is relaxing with a bowl of cereal and fruit - until she sees the balloon floating around outside.

Chilli: (gasps) Oh no!

Chilli runs off. Outside, she runs out after the balloon, Bluey and Bingo fast behind her.

Chilli: We can't let it touch the ground!

Bluey and Bingo: We know!

Bluey: Boot!

Chilli: No, I mean we really can't let it touch the ground. Balloons pop if they touch grass!

Bingo: What? You said nothing would happen!

Bluey: It's my last balloon!

Bingo: Catch it!

Bluey and bingo scream after the balloon. Bluey does a dive after it, hitting it up and over the fence to their neighbours'. Bluey and Chilli gasp, Bingo screams.

Bluey: It's going into Lucky's yard!

Over the fence, Lucky is kicking a rugby ball around. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli poke their heads over the fence to see the balloon slowly falling towards the grass.

Bluey: Lucky, the balloon!

Chilli: Get it, Lucky!

Lucky: I'll get it! Boot!

Bluey: Aah! Lucky!

Lucky: I'm not going to make it!

Chilli: Oh no!

Bluey: No!

Pat enters the scene, running after the balloon with a mug of liquid.

Pat: Mine! Mine!

Pat hits the balloon up, grunting.

Pat: Yours, Lucky! Get onto it!

Lucky: Good one, Dad! I got it! I got it! (grunts)

Pat: That's it, boy! I got it! Mine!

Pat lunges after the ball, but collapses in pain.

Pat: Uh! (moans) Oh, I've done me hammy! You get it, Lucky.

Bluey: Lucky! Get it!

Lucky: Ok, Bluey!

Lucky runs past a groaning Pat and dives to hit the balloon back into Bluey's backyard.

Lucky: Yaa! There ya go, Bluey!

Bluey: Thanks, Lucky's dad!

Pat: No worries, Bluey.

Back in the Heeler backyard, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are running after the balloon again.

Chilli: We can catch it! I can catch it!

Bluey and Bingo: Catch it, Mum!

Suddenly, Bandit puts up an umbrella, hitting the balloon.

Bandit: Looks like rain!

Chilli gasps as the balloon floats down onto the grass. It lands, and pops. Bluey and Bingo scream, Chilli winces.

Bluey and Bingo: No!

Bingo runs over to the remains of the balloon, and sighs sadly.

Bluey: Oh, my balloon.

Bingo: It's popped.

Bandit: It's all good; we can blow up another one.

Bluey: But that was my last balloon.

Bandit [realisation]: Oh. Did I make that a little too fun?

Bingo: Yes.

Bluey: Yeah, you did.

Bandit walks over and kneels next to his kids, putting an arm around Bingo.

Bandit: Sorry, squirts. It's a hard one to get right.

A moment of pause as they all stare at the popped balloon.

Bluey: It was pretty fun, though.

Bingo giggles.

Bingo: Yeah, it was definitely quite fun.

Cut to Lucky and Pat, looking over the fence.

Lucky: Yeah, it was really fun.

Back with the Heelers, Chilli kneels down next to the kids too.

Chilli: You know, I think we've got one last balloon left.

Bluey and Bingo: Really?

Bluey: For real life?

Chilli: Yeah, a big blue one.

Bandit anxiously gets up as Chilli looks at him.

Bandit: Uh-oh...

Cut to Bluey blowing on Bandit's tail, "inflating" him like a balloon. Bingo and Chilli stand nearby, watching and laughing as Bandit gets more inflated.

Bingo: Blow up the Daddy balloon! (giggles)

Chilli: Yeah! (laughs)

Soon, Bandit is fully inflated, with Bluey holding onto his tail.

Bluey: Ready!

Chilli: Shall we play Keepy Uppy?

Bluey: Uh-uh!

Chilli [knowingly]: Oh...

Bandit: What? What?

Bluey: Go free, birdie!

Bluey releases Bandit's tail, letting him run around the whole yard, making raspberry sounds like a deflating balloon. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli all laugh and giggle as Bandit flops all over the trampoline, before coming around and flying straight into them all.

Chilli: Oh no!

Bandit crashes into his family, grunting on impact. The Heelers lie in a pile, laughing.

[End credits]

The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a large band playing a fun groove - while the Heelers continue to laugh. Bluey is dancing.

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, three hot air balloons floating in the background. In the kids' bedroom, Bluey yawns as she wakes up and hops off the bed. She steps on an almost-empty bag of balloons.

Bluey: Ooh! Morning, balloons!

The final balloon falls out of the bag.

Bluey: I mean, morning, last balloon.

Bluey begins blowing up the balloon. In the living room, Chilli is holding Bingo over the couch.

Chilli: You ready?

Bingo: Ready!

Chilli: Keep your arms up!

Bingo does so, and Chilli drops her on the couch.

Chilli: Ah!

Bingo: (giggles) Again!

Bluey walks in, holding the now-inflated balloon.

Chilli: Morning, Bluey! Oh, what have you got there?

Bluey: This is my pet bird!

Bluey lets some air out of the balloon, making a squeaking sound. Bingo giggles.

Bingo: He's saying "Good morniiiiiing!"

Chilli: Oh, good morning, pet birdie.

Bluey: Go free, birdie!

Bluey lets go of the balloon, letting it fly wildly around the room. Everyone laughs, although Chilli briefly ducks for cover. When the air runs out, the deflated balloon lands on Chilli's head. She is a bit annoyed, but smiles seeing her daughters laughing.

Chilli: Oh, that's funny, is it?

Bluey: Yeah!

Bingo: Yeah, it is!

Chilli: Well, I've got a game for you.

She starts blowing up the balloon.

Bluey [excitedly]: Is it Keepy Uppy?!

Chilli: Yeah, it's Keepy Uppy.

Bluey does a little dance.

Bluey: It's Keepy Uppy! Woo!

TITLE CARD - a falling balloon and the episode title

Bluey [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: Keepy Uppy.

Back in the lounge room, Bingo and Bluey are standing in front of Chilli, who is holding the fully inflated balloon.

Bingo: What's Keepy Uppy?

Bluey: You have to keep the balloon in the air and can't let it touch the ground.

Bingo worriedly holds Bluey.

Bingo: What happens if it touches the ground?

Chilli: Oh, nothing, Bingo. It's just a game.

Bingo: Oh, ok.

Chilli: You ready?

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.

Chilli: Okay... go!

Chilli launches the balloon into the air and the game begins. The kids excitingly giggle and chase after it.

Bingo: Stop! Boot!

Bluey and Bingo keep giggling, "boot"ing the balloon to stop it from touching the ground.

Bluey: Boot!

Chilli runs over to the balloon.

Chilli: Boot!

Bluey: Aah, Bingo, quick!

Bingo chases the balloon across the living room.

Bingo: Yaa! Boot! (giggles)

Bluey: Boot! (giggles)

Bingo balks backwards into a pot plant to get the balloon.

Bingo: I got it, Bluey! Boot! Eee, get it!

Bluey: I got it, I got it!

Bingo: Bluey, get it!

Bluey: Yaah!

Bingo giggles. Chilli fixes up the pot plant as Bingo and Bluey continue playing.

Bluey: I got it!

Bingo: Oh, good.

Bluey: No, no, no, quick, quick!

Chilli "boot"s the balloon as it comes near her.

Chilli: Boot!

Bluey: Aah, Mum, you're making it harder!

Chilli: Ok, I'm going to cook brekkie, kids. Boot!

Bluey: Mum!

Chilli walks out, leaving Bluey and Bingo to continue playing and giggling.

Bluey: Look! What if we do small ones? Boot!

Bingo: Boot! This is so easy now.

Over in the kitchen, Chilli is making breakfast. Bluey and Bingo enter, still using small pushes to keep the balloon off the ground.

Bingo: Boot!

Bluey: Check it out, Mum! Boot!

Chilli: Hey, nice strategy balloon, girls!

Bingo: I'm a Keepy Uppy expert.

Bluey: Yep, but it's not as fun now. Can you make it hard again?

Chilli: Sorry, pickle, I've got my hands full.

Bandit enters the room with a basket full of washing.

Bandit [sung]: Oh good morning, everybody! Said good morning, everyone! Uh! [spoken] Whaddup, party people?

Bluey: Dad, we're playing Keepy Uppy. Can you make it harder?

Bandit walks over to Bingo.

Bandit: Ah, my newspaper.

Bandit grabs Bingo and holds her upside-down like a newspaper, leaving Bluey to frantically skid all over the floor to get the balloon.

Bingo: Dad!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, help!

Bingo: I can't! I'm a newspaper!

Bandit pretends to read the newspaper.

Bandit: Hmm, ah. Old so-and-so is at it again. Hmm, yes, yes...

Bluey gasps as the balloon flies out of her reach and over the counter, where it lands gently on top of a glass of orange juice.

Bluey: (gasps) Look! Wow.

Chilli turns around from the stove to see the balloon.

Chilli: Woah, look at that!

Bingo: Bluey, help!

Bluey: I'll save you, Bingo! Let her go!

Bluey tries to take Bingo out of Bandit's hands.

Bandit: Oh, you want to read the newspaper, Bluey? Ok, just don't do the sudoku.

Bandit lets Bluey have Bingo and walks over to the orange juice.

Bandit: Oh, look, lovely orange juice! Yes, please!

Bandit takes the juice, sending the balloon up and over towards the floor again. Bluey and Bingo scream.

Bluey: No, no, no! Boot!

Bingo [panting]: I'll get it!

Bluey: That's it, Bingo!

Bluey and Bingo run after the balloon, until Bandit grabs Bluey and embraces her Bluey screams and struggle, trying to get out of Bandit's grip.

Bandit: Oh, dear child. You grow up so fast.

Bluey: Ah, Dad, let go! Bingo, get it! Don't let it touch the ground!

Bingo is struggling all over the floor to stop the balloon from touching the ground.

Bingo: Bluey, help! I can't do it by myself!

Bandit: Dear child, embrace your father.

Bluey screams and pushes back against Bandit.

Bluey: Let go!

Bluey successfully gets out of Bandit's grip and starts helping Bingo.

Bluey: Boot!

Bingo: Aah, I'll get it!

Bandit [dramatically]: Oh, this heat is oppressive. I'll just turn on this fan...

Bandit activates a nearby pedestal fan, sending the balloon flying out of the kitchen. Bluey and Bingo scream.

Bluey and Bingo: Dad!

Over in the living room, Bluey and Bingo run in, chasing the balloon.

Bluey: Mine, mine!

Bandit: There's leaves everywhere!

Bandit is already there with a leaf blower. He blows the balloon out of the living room, Bluey and Bingo screaming as they run after it. In the playroom, Bluey and Bingo follow the balloon through lots of toys strewn around the room.

Bluey: There's too many toys on the ground! Boot!

Bingo: Who is responsible for this mess?

Bandit appears, lounging against the doorframe with a bowl of cereal and fruit.

Bandit: My, my, all these toys left lying around sure are making it difficult to keep the balloon up.

Bingo: We know!

Bandit: Can you imagine how easy this would be if you'd tidied them all away?

Bluey: That isn't helping!

Bingo: Oh no!

The balloon gently lands on top of a pile of blocks.

Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!

Bluey: Ha-ha, see, Dad? Our toys saved the balloon.

Bandit: Not for long!

Bandit turns on the ceiling fan, which blows the balloon off the block tower and towards the floor again.

Bluey and Bingo: No!

Bingo: You get it!

Bluey dives through the block pile to get the balloon, hitting it up.

Bluey: Yaa! (gasps)

Bluey: It's heading for the fan!

Bingo: Oh no!

The ceiling fan hits the balloon, sending it flying off. In the kitchen, Chilli is relaxing with a bowl of cereal and fruit - until she sees the balloon floating around outside.

Chilli: (gasps) Oh no!

Chilli runs off. Outside, she runs out after the balloon, Bluey and Bingo fast behind her.

Chilli: We can't let it touch the ground!

Bluey and Bingo: We know!

Bluey: Boot!

Chilli: No, I mean we really can't let it touch the ground. Balloons pop if they touch grass!

Bingo: What? You said nothing would happen!

Bluey: It's my last balloon!

Bingo: Catch it!

Bluey and bingo scream after the balloon. Bluey does a dive after it, hitting it up and over the fence to their neighbours'. Bluey and Chilli gasp, Bingo screams.

Bluey: It's going into Lucky's yard!

Over the fence, Lucky is kicking a rugby ball around. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli poke their heads over the fence to see the balloon slowly falling towards the grass.

Bluey: Lucky, the balloon!

Chilli: Get it, Lucky!

Lucky: I'll get it! Boot!

Bluey: Aah! Lucky!

Lucky: I'm not going to make it!

Chilli: Oh no!

Bluey: No!

Pat enters the scene, running after the balloon with a mug of liquid.

Pat: Mine! Mine!

Pat hits the balloon up, grunting.

Pat: Yours, Lucky! Get onto it!

Lucky: Good one, Dad! I got it! I got it! (grunts)

Pat: That's it, boy! I got it! Mine!

Pat lunges after the ball, but collapses in pain.

Pat: Uh! (moans) Oh, I've done me hammy! You get it, Lucky.

Bluey: Lucky! Get it!

Lucky: Ok, Bluey!

Lucky runs past a groaning Pat and dives to hit the balloon back into Bluey's backyard.

Lucky: Yaa! There ya go, Bluey!

Bluey: Thanks, Lucky's dad!

Pat: No worries, Bluey.

Back in the Heeler backyard, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are running after the balloon again.

Chilli: We can catch it! I can catch it!

Bluey and Bingo: Catch it, Mum!

Suddenly, Bandit puts up an umbrella, hitting the balloon.

Bandit: Looks like rain!

Chilli gasps as the balloon floats down onto the grass. It lands, and pops. Bluey and Bingo scream, Chilli winces.

Bluey and Bingo: No!

Bingo runs over to the remains of the balloon, and sighs sadly.

Bluey: Oh, my balloon.

Bingo: It's popped.

Bandit: It's all good; we can blow up another one.

Bluey: But that was my last balloon.

Bandit [realisation]: Oh. Did I make that a little too fun?

Bingo: Yes.

Bluey: Yeah, you did.

Bandit walks over and kneels next to his kids, putting an arm around Bingo.

Bandit: Sorry, squirts. It's a hard one to get right.

A moment of pause as they all stare at the popped balloon.

Bluey: It was pretty fun, though.

Bingo giggles.

Bingo: Yeah, it was definitely quite fun.

Cut to Lucky and Pat, looking over the fence.

Lucky: Yeah, it was really fun.

Back with the Heelers, Chilli kneels down next to the kids too.

Chilli: You know, I think we've got one last balloon left.

Bluey and Bingo: Really?

Bluey: For real life?

Chilli: Yeah, a big blue one.

Bandit anxiously gets up as Chilli looks at him.

Bandit: Uh-oh...

Cut to Bluey blowing on Bandit's tail, "inflating" him like a balloon. Bingo and Chilli stand nearby, watching and laughing as Bandit gets more inflated.

Bingo: Blow up the Daddy balloon! (giggles)

Chilli: Yeah! (laughs)

Soon, Bandit is fully inflated, with Bluey holding onto his tail.

Bluey: Ready!

Chilli: Shall we play Keepy Uppy?

Bluey: Uh-uh!

Chilli [knowingly]: Oh...

Bandit: What? What?

Bluey: Go free, birdie!

Bluey releases Bandit's tail, letting him run around the whole yard, making raspberry sounds like a deflating balloon. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli all laugh and giggle as Bandit flops all over the trampoline, before coming around and flying straight into them all.

Chilli: Oh no!

Bandit crashes into his family, grunting on impact. The Heelers lie in a pile, laughing.

[Theme Song]

The episode opens to a wide shot of Stripe’s car, driving through town in mild rain. The scene quickly cuts to the inside of the car, where Stripe is driving and Muffin, wearing a tiara, is sitting in her harnessed car seat in the back.

Muffin: So that’s why I’m going to write a letter to the toilet fairy.

Stripe: Well, that’s the only way things will change.

Muffin points ahead.

Muffin: Orange light, dad.

Stripe: Oop-

The view cuts back outside briefly; the car simply revs its engine a bit faster and drives through two orange-lighted traffic signals.

Muffin: Dad! You drove through an orange light!

Stripe: Uh, yeah I did.

Muffin: Didn’t you see it?

Stripe: Yeah, I saw it.

Muffin: But orange light means slow down and stop. Why didn’t you slow down and stop?

Stripe: Uh, well… This was a special case.

Muffin: Oh okay, dad. (pauses as she swings her legs back and forth, then stops) Are you special?

Stripe: Well, a little.

Muffin: Am I special?

The camera shot shows Stripe looking back at Muffin through the rear view mirror.

Stripe: Muffy, you’re the most special kid in the whole world.

Muffin: Ooh, interesting.

The scene moves to the Heeler household’s foyer. Muffin is loudly knocking on the door as Chilli is approaching with a folded towel.

Muffin: (through the door) Open the door!

Chilli: Okay, okay, coming.

Chilli opens the door for Muffin, whose feet are muddy.

Muffin: Hello!

Chilli sets the towel down in front of the doorway.

Chilli: Hi, Muffin.

Muffin proceeds to walk right inside, across the towel and tracking mud in her steps.

Chilli: Oh, wipe your feet on the towel, honey! It’s a bit-

Muffin: I don’t have to, Aunt Chilli, I’m special.

Chilli: Okay…

Stripe soon comes to the door afterward, carrying Muffin’s Cat Squad toy motorcycle under his arm. He stops on the towel and wipes his muddy feet on it.

Stripe: Hey, Chilli dog!

Chilli: Stripe.

Chilli and Stripe exchange cheek kisses.

Stripe: Bit muddy out there.

Chilli’s expression lowers disapprovingly.

TITLE CARD - A pinkish purple book with its spine facing to the left stacked on top of a lime green book facing the other way, and the episode title.

Muffin [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Library.

The scene enters the Heeler’s living room, set up to play “Library”. Many books are placed on the couch and a few more are propped up on the TV stand, where Bingo is standing. A drawing of someone yelling crossed out is taped to the arm of the couch. The yellow chair has been moved to the opposite side of the room and a circle of stuffed animals (Polly Puppy, a yellow bear with a red bowtie, Sir Frogdog, a blue whale, a brown racoon, and a purple octopus with a bowler hat) are positioned around it. A bean bag is in the middle of the room. The other side of the room now features a low coffee table, a cardboard box with a piece of paper taped on top, and an end table with its drawer removed and set behind it. Bluey is moving books from a cart to the couch as Muffin enters.

Muffin: Hi Bluey! Hi Bingo!

Bluey and Bingo: Hi Muffin!

Muffin: What are you playing?

Bluey: We’re playing library. I’m the library lady.

Bluey moves over to the coffee table. On top, two books, one pink and one green, are positioned like an open laptop, the green book “lid” supported by a wooden block. A tennis ball is set on top of a pink cylinder pencil case with a purple zipper and yellow flowers. To the other side of the table is a lime green book, a teal stamper, a red pencil, and three index cards: one orange and the other two pink.

Bluey: I’m the library lady. This is my desk. I’ve got a stamp (presses the stamp on one of the pink index cards leaving a blue heart print) and a computer.

Bluey moves over to the cardboard box, grabbing the lime green book and passing it across.

Bluey: And this is the book dooter where you get your book out.

Bluey pushes the book through the end table and drops it into the pushed-out drawer.

Bluey: And here’s where you return those books.

Muffin: Oh.

The camera cuts briefly to the drawing taped to the couch as Bluey points to it.

Bluey: This is a sign to say, “No talking loud.” And that’s it. (hesitates) Oh, wait! These are the books.

Bluey gestures to the wooden cart of books. Bingo is now sitting in the bean bag with a book and Poppy at her side.

Muffin: Wow!

Bingo: Shh!

Muffin: Can I play?

Bluey: Sure. Let’s get you a library card.

Muffin: (yelling) Okay!!

Bingo: Shhh!

The scene cuts to Bluey at her desk, pretending to type on her “computer” and adjusting the tennis ball on top of the pencil case.

Bluey: I’ll just take your picture. Look into this and smile.

As Muffin smiles widely, Bluey makes a camera shutter sound.

Bluey: Excellent.

Bluey types on the “computer” again briefly before moving to an orange index card and drawing Muffin on it.

Bluey: Just waiting for it to be ready. (hands the card to Muffin) There you go.

Muffin: I want a pink one!

Bingo: Shh!

Bluey: (whispering) Library cards are orange.

Muffin: But I want a pink one!

Bluey: (grabs the card back) Okay, I’ll do a pink one. Feel free to choose some books. Just remember to keep quiet.

Muffin: Okay.

As Muffin rushes off, Bluey starts redrawing Muffin onto a pink index card. Meanwhile, Bingo is turning the page of a pop up book to a blue bird-like dinosaur and a fish jumping out of the water.

Bingo: Ooh!

Muffin: (yelling from off screen) Books!

Muffin scoots into frame on her electronic Cat Squad bike, currently flashing lights and playing music, and bumps into Bingo’s bean bag. Bingo folds her ears down.

Cat Squad Bike: Cat Squad is here! (Muffin pushes the button at the front) Cat Squad is here!

Muffin: Cat Squad! (pumps her fist in the air)

Bingo: Muffin, shoosh!

Cat Squad Bike: (Muffin pushes the button again) Fear not! We are here for your purr-tection! Meow!

Muffin mouths the final “meow”, as Bluey approaches.

Bluey: Muffin!

Muffin: (pretending to rev the bike by leaning back) Vroom!

Bluey: (pushes the bike away) You can’t ride the Cat Squad bike into the library!

Muffin: Yes, I can! (leans back again) Vroom!

Muffin pushes the button on the front, causing it to play louder music. Bingo folds her ears down again.

Bingo: Stop it! Cut it out!

Bluey reaches under the Cat Squad bike to flip the off switch.

Muffin: Hey!

Bluey: (turning to Bingo) I’m sorry, library customer. (turns back to Muffin and hands her the pink index card) Here’s your library card, Muffin.

Muffin: Ooh, pink!

Bluey: Yes, it’s pink.

As Muffin dismounts the bike, Bluey pushes it away from the library area.

Bluey: Now, you can borrow any books you want.

Bingo turns the page of her popup book to a green t-rex and a blue velociraptor.

Bingo: Ooh!

Muffin notices and rushes up to grab the book.

Muffin: I want pop up book!

As Bingo tries to tug the book back away from Muffin, Bluey tries to pull Muffin away.

Bluey: Muffin, you can’t have that one.

The scene cuts to the kitchen where Chilli and Stripe are each enjoying a mug of coffee at the counter as Muffin enters.

Chilli: But, you know…

Muffin: Dad!

Stripe: Yes, Muffy?

Muffin: Bluey isn’t letting me play library.

Stripe: Oh.

Chilli and Stripe exchange glances.

Chilli: Bluey!

Bluey and Bingo enter.

Bluey: Yes, Mum?

Chilli: Can you include Muffin in your game, please?

Bluey: We are, but she’s not playing properly.

Stripe: Well, everyone has their own way of playing, Bluey.

Chilli briefly glares at Stripe.

Chilli: Just let Muffin play how she wants, okay honey?

Bluey: Okay…

Bluey dejectedly takes the popup book from Bingo and hands it to Muffin.

Bluey: Here you go.

Muffin: Hooray! (opens the book to the two dinosaurs) Rahhh!

The scene cuts back to the “library” where Bingo is moving three books, one at a time, across the cardboard box “book dooter”.

Bingo. Doot! Doot! Doot!

Bluey: So, Muffin, to borrow books, doot the corner like that.

Muffin: Okay.

Bluey: The library rules are… you can doot three books out at a time.

Bluey yelps as Muffin lifts an entire stack of books and sets them on the counter, moving each one on the stack across the “dooter”.

Muffin: Doot!! Doot!! Doot!!

Bluey: Muffin, that’s too many books.

Muffin: I can play however I want!

She continues frantically passing the books across while saying “doot”.

Bluey: Oh, yes, I forgot.

The scene cuts to Bluey in the chair opposite the library desk, surrounded by a circle of stuffed toys, now including Bingo with Poppy in her lap.

Bluey: Okay, children, welcome to Toddler Time!

Bingo: (softly, as Polly) Yay!

Bluey: Now, there aren’t any books left because Muffin has borrowed them all.

The camera zooms out to show Muffin sitting in the bean bag, surrounded by stacks of books. The book she has open has a few sound buttons on the side. She presses one and it makes a zebra’s whooping sound.

Muffin: Zebras are stripy!

Bluey pulls out a book with a scale on the front cover from behind her.

Bluey: But I did find this one in Dad’s office, but it doesn’t have any pictures.

Bingo: Aww…

Bluey: (opening the book) Once upon a time, there was… some words.

Muffin: (repeatedly pressing a button on her book that makes a cat's meow) Cat!

Bluey: And then there were some more words.

Muffin: (presses a button that plays an elephant’s trumpet) Elephant!

Bingo: Shh!

Muffin silently stands up and approaches with her book.

Muffin: Lion hungry!

Muffin presses a button that plays a lion’s roar and shuts the book on Poppy’s head, running away with both in tow. Bingo tries to reach out for her.

Bingo: Poppy!

Bluey: I’m sorry, children, but she’s allowed to do that.

The scene cuts to the library counter as Bluey claps for attention.

Bluey: Attention, library customers, your books are due back now. Please put them in the book mouth thing.

Bingo pushes her one book through the open desk.

Bluey: Thank you! You, too, Muffin.

Muffin opens her book, which plays “The Ants Go Marching”.

Muffin: No, I’m keeping them!

Bluey: You can’t keep library books, Muffin. If you don’t return them, other people can’t borrow them.

Muffin shuts and reopens her book, restarting the song.

Muffin: Everyone else has to return them but I get to keep them.

Bingo: Why do you get to keep them?

Muffin: ‘Cause I am the most special kid in the world!

Muffin closes and opens the book again.

Bluey: That’s it. (holds the book shut) You can be noisy, you can borrow all the books. You can even eat toddlers. But, you have to return your books. Otherwise, you’re not playing library properly.

After a brief bit of silence, Muffin reopens the book, restarting the music.

The scene cuts back to the kitchen as Bluey and Bingo enter dejectedly, sitting down under the counter.

Stripe: Couple of weeks later, and it’s still there.

Chilli: (notices Bluey and Bingo) What’s up, gang?

Bluey: Muffin’s not playing properly.

Chilli turns around the corner of the counter and kneels down to the girls’ level.

Chilli: Bluey, we spoke about this. Muffin can play however she wants.

Bluey: But, we’re playing library and she won’t return her books.

Bingo: She said she doesn’t have to follow the library rules.

Chilli: Oh.

Stripe: Did she say why?

Bingo: She says ‘cause she’s the most special kid in the world.

Stripe: (nervously realizing) Oh, oh, okay. I’ll be right back.

Chilli gives him a glare as he leaves the room, finding Muffin in the living room sitting on her Cat Squad bike, surrounded by books, and watching Cat Squad on the television.

Stripe: Hey, Muffy. (turns off the TV and kneels down to Muffin’s level)

Muffin: Hey!

Stripe: You know how I said you’re the most special kid in the world?

Muffin: Yes?

Stripe: Well, you’re not.

Muffin: Oh.

Stripe: I mean, you are to me and your mum. We love you more than anything. But, you’re probably not special to everyone else.

Muffin: Oh, okay!

Stripe: So, you have to follow the same rules as everyone, okay?

Muffin: Okay, dad! (sets down her book and goes to hug her dad)

Stripe: Thanks, kiddo.

The scene cuts back to the kitchen as Muffin rushes in, followed shortly by Stripe.

Muffin: Bluey! Guess what!

Bluey: What?

Muffin: I’m not special anymore!

Bluey and Bingo: (jumping back up to their feet) Hooray!

Muffin: Can we play library again? I promise I’ll return my books.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

The scene cuts back to a montage in the "library". Muffin is pushing books from her stack one at a time through the “book mouth” as Bluey takes them and puts them on her wooden cart.

Bingo is back in the bean bag chair, looking through a new popup book with Poppy, who now has the left side of her head bandaged. She turns the page to a popup of a cockatoo.

Bingo: Ooh!

Muffin is sitting on the couch, reading the green “Ants Go Marching” book. She briefly lowers it to shush the seagull plush sitting next to her.

Finally, the Toddler Time circle resumes, Muffin now joining the circle, as Bluey turns to the last page of a space-themed book.

Bluey: The end.

Bingo (as Poppy) and Muffin: Yay!

The scene cuts back to Stripe driving back home with Muffin in the backseat. Muffin has the animal sound book in her hands. She presses the buttons for the cat’s meow and the zebra’s whoop.

Stripe: You have a good time with the cousins, Muffy?

Muffin: Yeah, I did!

Stripe: Great.

Muffin: Can we play library when we get home?

Stripe: Sounds good! Oop, orange light.

The camera briefly cuts to an overhead shot showing the car slowly coming to a stop at the traffic signal.

Stripe: Better stop.

Muffin: Good one, dad.

Stripe: Thanks, princess.

[End credits]

During the end credits, the Cat Squad theme song plays as Muffin rides into the scene on her bike. She presses the button a few times and pretends to rev the engine. She starts riding off screen once the Screen Queensland logo appears.

The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house. Cut to a shot from under Bluey's pillow. She lifts the pillow.

Bluey: She came!

Cut to the kitchen. Bandit is reading the paper and eating cereal; Chilli is making tea. Bluey runs in, waving a $5 bill.

Bluey: The Tooth Fairy came!

Bluey begins to floss. Chilli attempts to join in but doesn't quite have the hang of it.

Chilli: Hey, nice one Bluey!

Bandit: Way to go, kid.

Bluey stops dancing and waves the bill around.

Bluey: She left me five bucks!

Bandit spits out his cereal.

Bandit: Five bucks?!

Bluey: Yeah, I know. Five bucks!

Bandit: (to Chilli) Five bucks?

Chilli: (to Bandit) That's what she left all Bluey's friends.

Bandit: Well, that Tooth Fairy's doing well for herself, isn't she?

Chilli: Hey, maybe you can spend it at the markets today.

Bluey: Yeah!

Bluey starts flossing again.

TITLE CARD - Markets

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Markets.

Cut to Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey walking through an open field. Bandit is swinging Bingo around as they walk. Bluey is staring at her $5 bill.

Bingo: (laughs)

Bandit rubs Bluey's head.

Bandit: This little piggy went to market...

Bandit rubs Bingo's head.

Bandit: and this little piggy stayed home.

Bingo: Hey, no I didn't! I'm coming too!

Bluey: Check this out, Bingo! The Tooth Fairy put a special sticker on here.

Bingo: Wow.

Bandit: What are you gonna spend it on, that's the question.

Bluey: Hmmm, that is a question.

Bingo: Hmm, question.

Cut to the markets. We see a number of stands selling food and crafts, with customers walking around. Cut to Indy's Mum's stall. It's decorated with Tibetan prayer flags. She's arranging baked goods, with a "no wheat" sign suggesting they are gluten free. Indy reaches up and dings a windchime. Bingo, Bluey, and Bandit approach.

Indy: Bluey!

Bluey: Indy!

Indy runs out to meet Bluey. They hug and laugh.

Bluey: Look, Indy. The Tooth Fairy gave me five bucks!

Indy: Wow! What are you gonna spend it on?

Bluey: I don't know. Can you come and help me?

Indy: Yeah! Mum, can I go and help Bluey?

Indy's Mum: Sure thing, Indy.

Bandit: I'll keep an eye on 'em.

Indy: Follow me!

Indy and Bluey run off. Bandit and Bingo follow at a walk. Cut to a stand selling bubble wands. The owner blows some large bubbles with a large bubble wand. Bluey runs in, with Indy riding piggyback.

Indy: Giant bubbles!

Bluey: Wooow!

The two run around popping bubbles for a moment.

Indy: Do you want to get one?

Bluey: Yeah, I do. Wait!

Cut to another booth. This one has two ponies - one with rainbow dyed hair and legwarmers, the other with teal hair and star anklets.

Indy: Pony ride!

Bluey: Excuse me. (pointing at teal pony) What's that pony's name?

Pony Lady: Her name's Biscuits.

Bluey and Indy: Awww!

Bluey: (pointing at rainbow pony) And what's that one's name?

Pony Lady: Buttermilk.

Bluey and Indy: Awww!

Indy: (whispering) I really, really want to ride Buttermilk.

Bluey: Definitely Buttermilk.

Bluey offers her money to the Pony Lady, who puts it in her pouch.

Bluey: Can we ride Buttermilk, please?

Pony Lady: Okay honey. Up you get.

Pony Lady picks Bluey up and sets her on Buttermilk's saddle.

Bluey: Okay, Indy, you can sit in front.

Pony Lady: Oh, I'm sorry, honey, you don't have enough money for two riders.

Bluey: Oh. I only want to go if Indy can come.

Indy: It's okay, Bluey. I'll wait here.

Bluey: Hmm. I think I've changed my mind.

The Pony Lady lifts Bluey back down and gives her money back.

Pony Lady: Well, aren't you a good friend?

Bluey: Yes, Pony Lady.

Bluey walks up to Buttermilk and pets her nose.

Bluey: Goodbye, Buttermilk. You're so beautiful.

--The next segment was cut from Disney-distributed versions--

Buttermilk lifts her tail and poops. A lot. Bluey and Indy run away screaming. Cut to another street at the market, Bluey and Indy enter, still screaming. They stop to laugh and catch their breath.

Indy: (enthusiastically) That was disgusting!

Bluey: Yeah!

Bandit and Bingo (chanting offscreen) German sausage! German sausage!

--End of cut segment--

Bluey and Indy join Bandit and Bingo, who are in line at the German Sausage stand.

Bandit, Bingo, Bluey, and Indy: (chanting) German Sausage! German Sausage!

Bluey and Indy run over to the condiments table.

Bluey: Okay, I want a German sausage, and the squirty sauce, but only on one end, so you can have the other end.

Indy: But I'm not allowed that.

Bluey: Why not?

Indy: Mum says it's got added ingredients...?

Bluey: Can you have barbecue sauce?

Indy: I'm not allowed that one either.

Bluey: Mustard?

Indy: I'm definitely not allowed mustard.

Bluey: Well, what are we gonna get then?

Poffertje Dog: (offscreen) Poffertjes! Poffertjes!

Bluey: Indy!

Cut to the poffertje stand. The owner is holding a plate of poffertjes and as the girls run up, he offers it to them.

Poffertje Dog: Poffertjes?

Indy and Bluey smell the poffertjes.

Indy: Have these got any wheat, sugar, gluten, or dairy in them?

Poffertje Dog: That's all they've got in them.

Bluey and Indy: Ohhh.

Bluey: My friend can't eat them.

Bluey and Indy walk away sadly.

Poffertje Dog: Bye, girls. Poffertjes!

Bluey: I just don't know what to get.

Winton's Dad enters with a single toffee apple on a tray.

Winton's Dad: Anyone want the last toffee apple? I've got one toffee apple left.

Bluey looks anxiously at the toffee apple.

Bluey: Oh, oh. I will!

Winton's Dad: Lovely jubbly.

Bluey pays him, and takes the apple. As Winton's Dad walks off, Indy points at the apple.

Indy: I'm pretty sure that has sugar in it.

Cut to an outdoor seating area. He's got his guitar case open in front of him for tips. There are several tables where people are eating food, including Bandit and Bingo. Busker is on a little stage on the left side, playing an acoustic guitar. Bingo is messily eating her German sausage. Bandit is going to take a bite of his, but stops as Bluey and Indy approach.

Bandit: Ah, toffee apple. Old school.

Bluey: I'm not sure I like this toffee apple. Plus, Indy can't have any.

Bandit: Oh, that's no good.

Cut to Busker's stage. A clearly nervous Buddy approaches the case and gingerly puts five bucks in.

Busker: (shouting) Ah, thanks buddy!

Buddy runs away screaming.

Buddy: Aaaaaaah!

Busker: That deserves a song.

Cut back to Bluey contemplating her toffee apple.

Bluey: Dad, I'm not sure I made the right choice. I think I want to put my five bucks in that case and get a song.

Bandit: Oh, right.

Bluey: Can I get my five bucks back?

Bandit: That's not really how it works, kiddo. Once you've spent money, it's... well, gone.

Bluey: Oh. Okay.

Indy: Don't worry, Bluey. My mum always says to me, "What goes around, comes around."

Bluey: (on the verge of crying) What does that mean?

Indy: I dunno.

Cut to the toffee apple stand. Winton's Dad takes out five bucks and hands it to Winton.

Winton's Dad: Sweetheart, can you go get your dad a German sausage please?

Winton: Okay, dad.

In a close up, we can see the sticker indicating this is Bluey's Tooth Fairy money. Cut back to Busker, beginning a new song.

Busker: Here we go!

Cut to Indy's Mom's stand. She begins to dance.

Indy's Mum: Now that's a tune.

At Gruber's Dad's German sausage stand, Winton spends the Tooth Fairy money on a sausage.

Winton: One sausage, please!

Gruber's Dad: Thanks. There you go.

Winton: Thanks!

Gruber's Dad gives Gruber the Tooth Fairy money.

Gruber's Dad: Gruber, go get me a carrot juice.

Gruber: Sure thing, Dad.

At Juniper's Mum's juice stand, Gruber spends the Tooth Fairy money on carrot juice.

Gruber: Carrot juice, please.

Juniper's Mum: Oh, we're out of carrots. Will you get me a bag of carrots please, Juniper?

Juniper's Mum gives Juniper the Tooth Fairy money.

Juniper: Yes, mum.

At a produce stand, Juniper buys a bag of carrots with the Tooth Fairy money.

Juniper: I'd like these carrots, please.

Honey's Mum buys a bag of mushrooms, and receives the Tooth Fairy money as change.

Honey's Mum: Just these, please.

Honey's Mum walks by Indy's Mum's stand. Indy's Mum is dancing enthusiastically. Honey's Mum buys a slice of cake with the Tooth Fairy money.

Honey's Mum: I'll have that one, thank you!

Indy's Mum: Indy?

Indy and Bluey run over.

Indy: Yes, mum?

Indy's Mum: Be a sweetie. Go and pop this in the guitar case for me.

Indy: Okay. Look, Bluey!

Bluey: (gasps)

We get a close up of Bluey looking at the sticker. At Busker's stage, Bluey puts the money in the guitar case.

Busker: Whoa! Five bucks? Thanks matey! That deserves another song! Who likes to dance? Two, three, four!

Busker starts another song. Bluey and Indy begin flossing. Bingo, Bandit, and Buddy join in. Cut to Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey walking home through the meadow. Bingo is riding piggyback on Bandit. Bluey is carrying her toffee apple.

Bandit: ...and this little piggy went, "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee" all the way home!

Bluey takes a bit of her apple. She loses a tooth, which sticks in the apple.

Bluey: Dad! I've lost another tooth!

Bandit: Ah, great.

[End credits]

Busker's song continues into the end credits. Bluey is replaced with Indy's Mum dancing.

(The episode starts outside the house with Bluey being heard, singing. Bandit is making toast, and Bingo is reading.)

Bluey (singing): Oh! Where is my toast?!

Bandit: Bluey! Can you be as quiet as Bingo for a bit?

Bluey (singing): No I can't!

Chilli: (Walks in) Bluey, I can't find your library books and they're due back. Have you seen Shmurdle The Dirty Turtle?

Bluey (singing): No, I have not seen Shmurdle The Dirty Turtle!

Chilli: You have to keep better track of your things.

Bluey (singing): What about Bingo?!

Chilli (offscreen): Bingo puts hers in a neat pile when she's read them.

Bingo: Finished.

Bandit: Ding, orders up!

Bluey: Ooh! Cheese and jam! (chomping)

Bingo: Dad, I don't like cheese and jam.

Bandit: What? I thought you did!

Bingo: No, Bluey does. I like banana and peanut butter.

Bluey: Bleh!

Bandit: How can you two come from the same parents, be raised in the same house, but be completely different?

Bluey and Bingo: Don't know.

Bandit: Well, I'll tell you this for free-- my life would be a lot easier if you both were the same.

Chilli: Tell me about it.

Bluey: Bingo, I've got an idea!

Bingo: Okay!

(both run off, giggling)

Bandit: Wait what? Hang on-- (groans)

Chilli: Why do you keep setting them up?

It begins from a distant view of the Heeler home at night, with the Heeler family entering their home.

Bluey: "HOOOME!"

Bingo: "Home!"

Bandit: "Ugh.."

Chilli: "What a day!"

Chilli yawning, on her way to the couch.

Chilli: "Cut us down kids."

Bandit: "Timber!"

Both Chilli and Bandit lie on the couch, Chilli is laying on the floor with her feet on the couch, adjacent to her is Bandit, who is on the couch with his head most likely not even touching the couch. The kids giggle.

Chilli, exhausted: "5 minutes until bed kids."

Bandit, also exhausted: "And, 5 years until the next trip to CrazyWorld."

Bluey: "Can we play a game?"

Bandit: "As long as it's 1 that you don't have to move any part of my body or say anything with my mouth.

Bandit: OK, now the movie's starting.

Bingo: This is boring.

Bandit: Bingo, shh.

Bluey: Is this the storm bit?

Bandit: Nah, it's just some monkeys in a tree.

Chunky: Hey, Chubbles, look what I invented.

Chunky: We can use it to explore the Groundlands.

Chubbles: Oh, Chunky. You and your inventions.

(Bingo laughs)

Bandit: Bingo, sit still.

Chubbles: Why can't you just be like the rest of us?

Chubbles: Why do you have to be SO different?

Chunky: I don't know.

(Chunky sings) “I wish I wasn't different...”

Bandit: Oh, man, there's songs.

(Chunky continues singing) “I wish I were the same...”

Bingo: Ow, my popcorn.

Bandit: One popcorn, please.

Unnamed employee: Sure.

Bandit: Bingo, don't touch that.

Bluey: Dad, am I different, like Chunky is?

Bandit: Huh?

Bandit: Uh, yeah, well, uh, no.

Bandit: Bingo, no, mate.

Bluey: I think I am different.

Bluey: I'm the only one of my friends who doesn't watch movies.

Bluey: I wish I wasn't different.

Bandit: Look, mate, I'm pretty sure that by the end of the movie, everyone will like that the monkey was different.

Bandit: Ow!

(Bluey and Bingo laugh)

Bandit: Don't spill 'em, Bingo. Don't spill 'em.

Bluey: Well, I am not gonna be different anymore.

Bluey: I’m ready for movies.

Bluey: Just like everyone else.

Chubbles: The Groundlands aren't for chimps.

Chubbles: Tree World is where we belong.

Chunky: But my heart belongs to the Groundlands. I don't care, you need to stay here...

Bingo: Can I sit over there?

Bandit: No, mate, we're sitting here.

Bingo: But I want to go down there.

Chunky: But I want to go down there.

Bandit: No, you have to stay here with me.

Chubbles: No, you have to stay here with me.

Bingo: But I want to explore!

Chunky: But I want to explore!

Bandit: Uh, well, uh, you know.

Bingo: Finished!

Bandit: Bingo, you gotta flush. Come on!

(Toilet flushes)

Bluey: Am I just being yourself?

Bandit: Bluey, open your eyes.

Bluey: But the scary bit’s on.

Bandit: It’s just a monkey in the rain.

(Bingo laughs)

Bandit: Ooh! (falls)

Bandit: Bluey, open your eyes and help me.

Bluey: I can't do it. I'm not ready.

Chunky: I can't do it. I'm not ready.

Chunky: I should have just stayed in the trees like everyone else.

Magic pinecone: But you didn’t.

Chunky: Huh?

Magic pinecone: You rode off to save the village, because there is nobody else quite like you.

Magic pinecone: Now, fly, Chunky.

Chunky: Whoa!

(Bluey gasps)

Chunky: Yeah! Woo!

Bluey: He made it!

(Bingo giggles)

Bluey: Gotcha.

Bandit: Nice one, Bluey.

All: Hooray! Whoo-hoo!

Bluey: Dad, look, the storm is over.

Bandit: Oh, yeah. Nice one.

Bluey: Can we stay?

Bandit: What? Really?

Bluey: Um, yeah.

Bandit: OK, we're staying.

Bingo: Oh, I don’t want to stay.

Bandit: I know, mate, but it’s important for Bluey.

Bingo: So what do I do?

Bandit: You know what, Bingo?

Bandit: Just be yourself.

Chunky: “Now it all worked out. Everything’s fine. Living in the trees and the ground sometimes. All because… You learned to be yourself. Be yourself” (song continues into outro)

(Episode starts with Chilli blowing a pale blue balloon)

Chilli: That’s gonna have to do for this one.

Bluey: Thanks Mum!

(Bingo runs into the room with a pink towel, giggling while escaping Bandit)

Bandit: While chasing Bingo; Hey! Come here!

Chilli: Aw Bingo, good girl for having your bath.

Bandit: Yeah but she hasn’t cleaned her teeth!

(Bingo squeals and runs out of the scene with Bandit chasing after her)

Bandit: Come here!

Chilli: It’s your bath time too Bluey. I can smell you from here!

Bluey: Aw, but I wanted to play Mum School with you.

Chilli: What’s Mum School?

Bluey: It’s a school where you learn to be a mum. (Bluey points to her balloon children)

Bluey: This is Kiwi (red), Windgust (purple), Lightning Bolt (yellow), Dronigan (pink) and that’s Pearl! (pale blue) They’re my children! I gave birth to them all.

Chilli: (reasonably concerned) Oh my goodness…

Chilli: (looks up at the ceiling, pointing to a green, helium balloon) What about that one?

Bluey: (grabs claw toy, stands on the couch and pulls the green ballon by it’s string) Oh Greeny, you’re such a pickle!

Chilli: Okay, I’m running the bath.

Bluey: No:, not yet! (grabs clipboard) You’re the lady who gives me a score for being a good mum.

Chilli: Oh, you don’t need someone keeping score of your mothering!

(Greeny floats back up to the ceiling)

Bluey: Ah, not again! I’ll get you down.

(Bluey grabs a cushion and throws it close to Greeny, though it falls back down on the other children balloons, which make them disperse)

Bluey: Ooh! Sorry kids!

Chilli: On second thoughts…

(Title Card Plays): This episode of Bluey is called Mum School

(Bluey pushes the couch with the balloon kids sitting on it)

Bluey: Argh! Okay children! Movie time now! Everyone sit up straight. And not on top of each other. Lightning Bolt, please get off Windgust. Okay good.

(Bluey picks up Lightning Bolt, but Greeny floats up, although she catches his string)

Bluey: Agh! Uh Greeny, maybe you should hold Mummy’s hand.

Chilli: Oh, very good. Two points. (writes on clipboard)

Bluey: Okay, movie time! (grabs remote) Which button is it? (Greeny covers Bluey’s view of the remote buttons) Oh! Greeny I’m trying to concentration honey. Hmmm (Greeny repeats his previous action) Oh! Hop over there!

(Bluey pushes Greeny away, which makes him hit the other resting balloons)

Bluey (as Windgust): Wah! Mummy, Greeny pushed me!

Bluey (normal): Greeny, what has gotten into you? (places him on the couch with a cushion over his head so he doesn’t fly off) Now keep your hands to yourself please young man.

Bluey (as Windgust again): Na Na! Greeny’s a cushion head!

Bluey: Windgust! We do not call people cushion head in this house!

Chilli: Hm! Good mothering.

(Bluey pushes Greeny to Windgust)

Bluey (as Windgust): Wah mama! Greeny hit me!

Bluey: Well, you kinda had that coming.

Chilli: I’m not sure about that.

(Bluey grabs the cushion and throws it on her balloon children, which makes them disperse again)

Bluey: Yah! (giggles, but spots Greeny floating again) Greeny honey, come down from there!

Chilli: I think these kids need some exercise. How about everyone goes for a nice swim in the indoor pool?

Bluey: Yeah! Come on you lot! (Runs and kicks the balloons to Chilli)

(Meanwhile, it cuts to Bingo still running away from Bandit in the hallway)

Bandit: Come back here and clean your teeth young lady!

Bluey: (while kicking the balloons casually) Come on, come on! This way to the pool! Argh! Walk straight! Ugh, it’s so difficult when they just ignore me!

Chilli: Yes it is.

Bluey: Why can’t you kids just walk in a straight line?

Chilli: They don’t know how. You have to show them.

Bluey: (grabs a wrapping paper tube) I’m just gonna show you something kids! (Whacks balloon kids to the bathroom with the tube. Chilli is concerned, but Bluey giggles)

Chilli: I don’t think that’s a good idea.

Bluey: Well I don’t have any other ideas! (whacks Kiwi and Pearl to the bathroom and giggles) Come on Greeny, you’re old enough to walk by yourself.

Chilli: Greeny finds walking a little tricky.

Bluey: Oh nonsense, he’s got two legs. (whacks Greeny with the tube, though Greeny still tries to fly up) This way! No no, stay down. (giggles) I don’t understand why you keep running off!

Chilli: I don’t think he can help it.

(Scene cuts to the bathroom, with all the balloons in the tub except for Greeny, who’s under the laundry basket)

Bluey: Okay! That’s everyone in the pool! Enjoy your swim sweeties! Now Greeny, if I let you out of there, are you going to behave yourself or are you just gonna float up to the roof?

Chilli: I think you know the answer.

Bluey: No problem! I’ll just get old Boonty out. (grabs wrapping paper tube)

Chilli: No more Boonty in Mum School.

Bluey: Well then what am I meant to do?

Bandit (offscreen): Gotcha!

Chilli: Ooh! One moment, I just have to mark this other student. He’s in Dad School! (sits in the shower with Bluey)

Bandit (enters the scene carrying Bingo, who’s giggling ): Aw man! This sack of potatoes sure is heavy!

Bingo: Put me down!

Bandit: You got it! (puts her down but she runs off) Hey! (catches Bingo before she escapes, who’s squealing) Gee, she’s quick!

Chilli: Oooh, making it fun. Two points!

Bandit: Now clean.

(Bingo grabs her toothbrush and brushes her teeth, while Bandit pulls out his phone. However, Bingo notices this and runs away again)

Bingo: Yeah!

Bandit: Hey!

Chilli: Ooh, he’s let himself down there!

(Bingo giggles, but Bandit catches her)

Bandit: Argh!

Bingo: No! (grabs onto towel)

Bandit: (trying to get Bingo off the towel) Bingo! Let go!

Bingo: Unhand me!

Bandit: Time to bring out the big guns! (tickles Bingo) Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

Chilli: Ooh, good move!

Bandit: (finally pulls Bingo off the towel) Nrghh! Gotcha!

Bingo: I don’t want to clean my teeth!

Bandit: Argh, Bingo. There must be a reason why you’re being such a pickle tonight. Hmm. I think you’re still hungry. Come on, you need more food. I’ll race you to the kitchen! Go!

Bingo: ARGHH!

(Bandit and Bingo race offscreen to the kitchen)

Chilli: Whack-a-doo! Top marks!

Bluey: Oooh!

Chilli: Now, do you wanna have another go with Greeny?

(Bluey looks at Greeny, walks out of the shower and removes him from the basket)

Bluey: Hi sweetheart. I think there’s a reason you keep floating off, isn’t there? Hmmm, what could it be? Maybe you just like exploring! Aww, that’s nice Greeny! Well, you’re not old enough to go exploring too far yet. So, this is a special present for you. (grabs a plastic magnet and ties it to Greeny’s string) Because I love you so much. One day you can float up as high as you want. But for now, this will help you stay down here with us.

(Bluey hugs Greeny. Chilli smiles)

Bluey: (climbs into the tub with Greeny) Now, everyone in the pool! (squeals and giggles while splashing water everywhere)

Chilli: Nice work Mum.

Bluey: Sit children! Pearl, get off Dronigan! (giggles)

(After the bath, Chilli and Bluey are in the bedroom, drying off the balloons with hairdryers and towels)

Bluey: drying Greeny with a towel) There you go darling, all dry.

Chilli: Excellent drying! You’ve almost passed Mum School.

Bluey: Oooh! Did you hear that kids?

(Chilli stops the hairdryer)

Bluey: Excuse me, can I have a go at the hairdryer?

Chilli: (lends hairdryer to Bluey) Okay. Just be careful.

Bluey: Woooh! (turns on the dryer and makes it spin in all directions. The balloons disperse off again, however Greeny is floating towards the balcony. Bluey giggles as well) Oh sorry children!

(Bluey notices Greeny flying out the balcony)

Bluey: Oh! Greeny! (Bluey and Chilli run after him, but he’s too far now) Greeny no! Can you get him back?

Chilli: No honey, he’s off.

Bluey: Will he be okay?

Chilli: Yeah, I think he’ll do just fine.

Bluey: How do you know?

Chilli: Because he’s got a good mum.

Bluey: Does this mean I failed Mum School?

Chilli: Well, yeah.

Bluey: Aw, I’m such a cushion head.

Chilli: But that’s okay. We all fail Mum School sometimes.

Bluey: Oh! Okay.

Chilli: We can just start again tomorrow. (walks back into the house with Bluey)

Bluey: Thanks Mum.

Dad: Snap! Ha-ha! Yeah!

Bluey: Oh, you win every time!

Dad: 'Cause you're too slow.

Bingo: You need to let Bluey win sometimes.

Dad: Why would I do THAT?

Mum: Because she's a child.

Dad: You don't want me to let you win, Bluey. Trust me.

Bluey: Why not?

Dad: Because you'll give up trying to get better.

Mum: And what does losing EVERY TIME do?

Dad: Nothing much.

Mum: Oh, really? Care for a game of memory snap?

Dad: No way! I hate memory snap.

Mum: And why is that?

Dad: Because I lose every time. Snap! Ha-ha!

Bluey: Ohh!

Dad: I'm like a mongoose.

Bluey: No, he would just jump.

Mum: Well, then YOU'VE got to jump.

Bluey: But it's too high!

Mum: No, it's not.

Bingo: Come on, Bluey! Hurry!

Bluey: Isn't there an easier way to be Dad?

Mum: I think the mongoose couldn't handle losing to a child.

The episode opens with a first-person shot from Bandit's perspective as he opens his eyes. He sees Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo right in front of him. He awakes with a jerk.

Bandit: (snorts) Aaah!

The shot cuts to a third person view. Bandit is lying in bed, with Chilli standing beside him and Bluey and Bingo sitting on the bed.

Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo: Happy Birthday!

Bandit: Oh, wow. Thanks, girls!

Bluey: Uh-uh! Down, down. Stay.

Bingo: We're going to make you breakfast in bed.

The girls climb down off the bed.

Bandit: Oh, great! Uh... Just a friendly question...

Chilli: Don't worry, it won't take long.

Bandit: Oh, thanks.

Chilli: Because we know how you get when you're hungry.

Chilli exits.

Bluey: Cranky.

Bluey exits.

Bingo: Stay.

Cut to the kitchen. Bluey and Chilli enter, followed by Bingo.

Chilli: Alright, here's the plan: I'll make Dad an omelette, Bluey, you set the brekkie tray, and Bingo, you make the birthday card. Quickly! We don't want Dad getting hungry.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay!

Bluey and Bingo run off. Chilli puts on an apron.

Chilli: Okay, super-quick omelette.

Chilli waggles her fingers.

Chilli: My specialty. Oh!

Chilli takes a step back, Bingo has appeared right in front of her.

Chilli: Hi, Bingo.

Bingo: Hi.

Chilli: Are... you going to get started on the birthday card?

Bingo holds up a card.

Bingo: I already made one at kindy.

Cut to a close up of Bingo holding up the card. It shows Bandit driving the car.

Chilli: Oh! That's lovely!

Cut back to the wider shot.

Bingo: I want to help you make the omelette.

Chilli: (dismayed) Oh. That's...lovely.

TITLE CARD - Omelette

The title card shows a burnt omelette with bits of shell in it.

Bingo: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Omelette.

Cut back to the kitchen. Chilli and Bingo are standing at the counter; Bingo is standing on the step stool.

Bingo: What do we do first?

Chilli: Well, first we need some eggs.

Bingo: Ooh, no, I can get them!

Chilli: Oh, okay.

Bingo starts shoving the wooden step stool across the floor. It makes a loud scraping sound. Chilli covers her ears.

Chilli: Oh, Bingo! That's awfully loud, honey!

Bingo pushes the stool all the way up against the freezer, walks up the steps, and opens the refrigerator.

Bingo: Come here, eggies!

Bingo removes a topless carton of eggs from the fridge. She knocks a stalk of celery onto the floor.

Bingo: Not you, celery!

Chilli: I'll get that.

Chilli picks the celery up and puts it back in the fridge. She closes the door

Bingo climbs down from the stool. She's holding the carton of eggs by the very end, and it bends dangerously.

Chilli: Oh. Uh. Do you want me to carry those for you?

The carton bends further.

Bingo No! It's okay. I'm almost there!

Two of the six eggs fall out of the carton and break on the floor.

Bingo: Oops!

Chilli: It's okay! I'll clean it up.

Chilli gets a roll of paper towels.

Bingo: No, I can do it!

Chilli: Okay. Here's the paper towels.

She hands the paper towels to Bingo.

Bingo: (giggles) and... hup!

Bingo throws the roll of paper towels out the window, unrolling a streamer of towels behind it. She reels in a dozen or so paper towels.

Chilli: I'll make a start on the omelette, honey. I'll just crack the eggs.

Bingo has arranged the towels into a pile on top of the eggs.

Bingo: Can I help crack the eggies?

Chilli: Um... Sure, honey. How about I sort this out and you get started on the eggs?

Chilli takes over the pile of paper towels.

Chilli : Grab a silver bowl from the cupboard.

Bingo: Okay.

Bingo runs off, and Chilli starts to clean up the eggs. A moment later, a loud crash sounds from offscreen.

Chilli: (yelps)

A bowl rolls into the shot and spins around on its rim.

Cut to a wider shot showing Bingo surrounded by pots and pans. She's holding up a silver mixing bowl.

Bingo: Is this one okay?

Chilli smiles.

Cut to Bandit in bed. He's rapidly flipping through a surfing magazine. He winces.

Bandit: Oh, man. I'm getting hungry.

Cut to the dining room. Bluey hums as she puts salt and pepper shakers on the breakfast tray.

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo climbs the step stool and puts the silver bowl on the counter.

Bingo: How many eggs are in an omelette?

Chilli is stacking bowls back in the cupboard.

Chilli: Um... Three or four.

Bandit: (yelling from offscreen) I'm hungry!

Chilli: Better make it four.

Bingo counts out the eggs, laying each one on the counter, where they slowly roll away.

Bingo: One. Two. Three.

Chilli: Come on Bingo, bit quicker.

Bingo: Four--

Bingo notices her eggs are about to roll off the counter.

Bingo: Oh, no!

Bingo grabs the silver bowl and climbs down the steps. She runs to the end of the counter, and uses the bowl to catch the eggs.'

Bingo: Agh! One!

She leaps to the right to catch the second egg.

Bingo: Ee! Two!

And back to the left for the third egg.

Bingo: Agh! Three!

She looks around.

Bingo: Hey, where's four?

Chilli closes the cabinet and gets up.'

Chilli: Done. How are the eggs doing, Bingo?

The fourth egg rolls off the side of the counter instead of the end, cracking at Chilli's feet.

Chilli: Ooh!

Bingo: There's four!

Cut to the bedroom.

Bandit: Hello?! Is brekkie almost ready?!

Cut back to the kitchen. Chilli is wiping up the egg.

Chilli: It's coming!

Chilli stands up and claps her hands together.

Chilli: Okay, birthday boy's getting cranky. Let's get cracking, Bingo. Ha! Get it? "Cracking"!

Bingo giggles, then smacks her egg down on the side of the silver bowl. The egg doesn't break, but the force of the blow launches the bowl off the table. The shot pulls back to show Bluey walking across the kitchen with a carton of orange juice. The bowl hits the orange juice, knocking Bluey over and spilling orange juice on the floor in front of the fridge.

Bluey: (yelps)

Chilli Ohmygoodness!

Bingo: Sorry, Bluey!

Bluey sits up.

Bluey: It's okay, I'll clean it up.

The shot cuts back to show just Chilli and Bingo at the counter.

Chilli: Thanks, Bluey.

Chilli holds the bowl in place for Bingo.

Chilli: Okay, try again, honey.

Bluey: (offscreen) Agh!

A roll of paper towels soars over Chilli's head, bouncing off the wall.

Chilli: I'll just hold it for you.

Bingo repeatedly taps the egg on the edge of the bowl.

Chilli: A bit harder, honey.

Bingo taps the egg slightly harder.

Chilli: Give it a good whack.

Bingo: Rrrah!

Bingo winds up and smashes the egg on the edge of the silver bowl. Yolk and albumen splatter the bowl, countertop, Chilli, and Bingo.

Bingo: (giggles)

Chilli: That's too hard.

Bingo drops the eggshells into the bowl.

Chilli: Oh, uh... No, honey, the shells don't go in.

Chilli removes the eggshells. She hands Bingo a new egg.

Chilli: Let's try again.

Bingo: Okay.

Bingo resumes tapping the egg lightly.

Chilli's phone rings. Caller ID shows it's Bandit. Chilli taps the button with her pinky.

Chilli: Hello?

Cut to the bedroom.

Bandit: Hi. Uh... Will breakfast be in my mouth soon?

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo is still tapping the egg.

Chilli: It's on its way!

Chilli holds the phone close to her mouth and turns away.

Chilli: (quietly) I'm just letting Bingo help me.

Bingo winds up for a big hit.

Cut to the bedroom.

Bandit: I don't want to complain, but--

A wet squelch is heard over the phone.

Chilli: (over the phone) Agh!

Bingo: (over the phone) Sorry!

Bandit: Was that my breakfast?!

Cut back to the kitchen. Fresh egg drips from Bingo and Chilli's faces.

Bingo: That was a big one.

Chilli: I've got to go.

Chilli hangs up the phone.

Chilli: Bingo, I might handle the omelette, honey.

Bingo: Oh, you don't want my help?

Chilli: Um... I do, but it might be quicker if I do it.

Bingo: Oh. Okay.

Chilli: Why don't you help Bluey set the breakfast tray?

Bluey: I don't need help. I'm finished!

Bingo: Ohh.

Chilli: Well, um... Oh, look, Bingo - you could play with the salt and pepper soldiers. You love them.

Bingo: Okay, Mama.

Bingo sadly climbs down the step stool. Chilli watches sadly. The phone rings, Chilli picks it up.

Chilli: (annoyed) It's coming!

Cut to inside the fridge. Chilli opens the door, grabs the celery, and hands it to Bluey.

Chilli: Bluey, run this celery up to Dad.

Bluey: Yes, Mum!

As Bluey runs out, Chilli cracks her knuckles.

Chilli: Okay. Extra-super-quick omelette. Also my specialty.

In a montage, Chilli cooks an omelette. She cracks eggs into a bowl and whisks them. She melts butter in a frying pan, and pours the eggs on top. She wipes up some spilled egg with a tea towel.

Cut to the bedroom. Bandit devours the celery while Bluey backs away slowly.

Cut back to the kitchen. Chilli turns a perfect omelette out onto a plate.

Chilli: Alright, omelette: done.

Bingo: (offscreen) (as pepper soldier) Where are you going?

Cut to show Bingo playing with the salt and pepper soldiers in the dining room.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) I'm off to guard the queen. That's my job.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Ooh. I'll come too.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) No, you can't guard the queen.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Why not?

Bingo: (as salt soldier) You're not good at it.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) I am. Really, I am.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) No. You better stay at home.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) But I'm a guard just like you.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) Yes, but you're not a proper guard like me.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Oh. OK then.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) Bye!

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Bye!

Bingo walks the salt soldier over to the breakfast tray.

Bingo: Doo, doo-doo, doo.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) (addressing the orange juice) Hello, Queen.

Bingo: (as Queen Orange Juice) Oh, hello.

Cut back to Chilli in the kitchen, who has been watching this whole exchange. Her phone rings. She answers.

Chilli: (imitating error message) The number you have dialed has been disconnected.

Bandit: (on phone) Hey, what?!

Chilli: Bingo, come here.

Bingo walks over and climbs up to the counter.

Chilli: I made an omelette for Dad, but... I didn't make it the right way.

Bingo: Really?

Chilli: Yeah. I need your help making another one.

Bingo perks up and wags her tail.

Bingo: Okay!

Bandit walks in, wearing a blanket as a cape. Bluey is laying on the cape in a futile attempt to slow him down.

Bandit: (hoarsely) Is that an omelette I can smell?

Bingo and Chilli: Get back upstairs!

Bandit: (hoarsely) It is! Can I just...

Chilli threatens him with the whisk.

Chilli: No! This isn't for you.

Bingo: (giggles)

Bandit: (hoarsely) Wha-? Well, who's it for?

Bluey starts to shove Bandit out of the room.

Bluey: You go, I'll take care of Dad.

Bandit: Please!

Bingo: (giggles)

Bandit: I need food!

Cut to the back yard. Chilli is holding Bingo in one arm, and accepting a carton of half a dozen eggs from Pat across the back fence.

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo cracks an egg, getting half of it down the outside of the bowl. She throws in the shell. Bingo facepalms.

Cut to Bingo mixing the eggs with great speed and enthusiasm. She gets so worked up she overturns the whole bowl.

Cut to the bedroom. Bandit is sitting in the bed again . Bluey is standing with a pillow held menacingly. She glares at Bandit.

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo cracks and egg and throws away the shell.

Cut to Bingo mixing eggs - this time, she only slops a little out of the bowl.

Cut to the stove - Chilli is holding out the frying pan, and Bingo tries to pour the bowl of eggs into it. She misses. Chilli lunges with the pan but only catches a few drops.

Cut to the side yard. Chilli and Bingo borrow another half-dozen eggs from Wendy and Judo.

Cut to the bedroom. Bluey is marching back and forth with her pillow. Bandit tries to get out of bed, and she runs up and threatens him with the pillow. Bandit grins sheepishly.

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo cracks and egg and gets the whole contents in the bowl.

Bingo mixes the eggs smoothly, and doesn't slop any out of the bowl.

She pours the eggs into the pan, and this time, they all go in.

Cut to the stove. Chilli is holding the pan while Bingo attempts to flip the omelette with a spatula. She accidentally turns it out onto the burner. They both gasp. Chilli grabs it bare handed and tosses it back into the pan. She gives Bingo a thumbs-up and they both smile.

Chilli turns the omelette out onto a plate. It's burnt and has eggshells in it. They both look at it proudly.

Cut to the bedroom. Bandit is grasping weakly for the potted plant on the nightstand.

Bandit: Maybe...I could eat this...plant.

Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey enter. Bingo is carrying the breakfast tray.

Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey: Happy birthday!

Bandit spins around on the bed.

Bandit: Is that food?!

Chilli: Sure is!

Chilli raises up the tray while Bingo is still holding it.

Bingo: I made you an omelette.

Bandit: Give it here!

Bandit snatches the tray. Bluey and Bingo flinch back.

Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey: (yelp)

Bandit picks up the omelette bare handed and starts to gobble.

Bandit: (munching loudly) NOM HOM! AHM MNAM MNAM!

Chilli: Stand back, Bingo! You might lose a finger!

Bluey: Whoa!

Bingo hides the hand closest to Bandit.

Bandit: (munching loudly) AHM MNAM MN MN! OHM MNAM ONG! NYANG NYANG!

He finishes the last of the omelette and chugs the glass of orange juice.

Bandit: (chugging) Glug glug glug!

Bandit: (sighs) A-a-a-a-a-a-hh!

The girls relax.

Bingo: Did you like it?

Bandit: Bingo, I'm gonna be completely honest: That was the best omelette I've ever had in my life.

Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey: Hooray!

Bandit: Can I have another one?

Bingo: Yes!

Chilli reaches for the breakfast tray.

Chilli: Let me clean this away for you, birthday boy.

Bingo stops her.

Bingo: No, Mum, I can do it.

Chilli: Oh! Okay. Thanks, Bingo.

Bluey: I'll help you!

Bingo: Thank you.

They each take one side of the tray and carry it out of the room.

Bandit picks something out of his teeth.

Bandit: I think there were a few eggshells in that omelette.

Chilli: Well, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few--

A loud thump and clatter sounds from offscreen. Bandit and Chilli wince.

Bluey and Bingo: (offscreen) We'll clean it up!

Chilli: --eggs.

[End credits]

The episode music continues through the credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, the screen is blank for a few seconds, then an egg falls from the top of the screen and breaks.

Chili: She sort-of becomes one with the onesie.

Brandy: What?

Bluey: Where’d she go?

Chili: I don’t know!

(Bandit presses his hand on the car window scaring the girls)

Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)

Bandit: Did you.. get her.. the onesie?!

Brandy: I didn’t know, I’m sorry!

(Bingo attacks Bandit)

Bandit: (screams)

Bluey: Don’t worry, we can live in the car!

Chili: Yeah, there’s plenty of food under the seats!

Brandy: Yeah, and we’ve got music!

Bluey: Oh, yeah!

Chili: Brandy, what was it that you wanted to say earlier?

Brandy: Uhh…Um..

Bingo: (growls)

Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)

Chili & Brandy: Get out!

They all scream and run away from Bingo

Bluey: Let’s hide behind the shed!

Brandy: I think we lost her!

Chili: (sighs with relief)

Bluey: Auntie Brandy, was there a medium size onesie at the shop?

Brandy: Um, I’m not sure Bluey.

Bluey: Can you ring them and ask?

Chili: Bluey!

Bluey: What?

Brandy: Sorry, Bluey, the last time I saw you zebras were your favorite animal.

Bluey: They used to be, but I changed to cheetahs.

Chili: Four years ago.

Brandy: Look, I have to go, this was a mistake.

Chili: No, Brandy, I’m sorry, don’t go!

Brandy: Say goodbye to Bi…Ahhh!

Bingo attacks Brandy.

Chili & Bluey: Brandy!

Brandy: Run! Save yourselves! (Laughs)

Chili and Bluey run inside to hide in the bathroom tub.

Chili: I think we’re just going to have a no onesie policy from now on.

Bluey: Mum, why did Auntie Brandy want to leave? Is she sad? And why have we only seen her once in our lives?

Chili: (Sighs) You know how you really want Bingo’s cheetah onesie?

Bluey: Yeah, more than anything!

Chili: But it doesn’t fit you, so you can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do to make it fit.

Bluey: (Sadly) Yeah.

Chili: Well…

Cuts to the backyard where Bingo’s attacking Brandy while she’s laughing.

Chili: (continues)…there’s something Auntie Brandy wants more than anything as well, but she can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do about it.

Bingo runs away growling, while Brandy looks sad.

Bluey: Why can’t she just have the thing she wants?

Chili: Because it’s not meant to be.

Chili and Bluey check on Brandy in the backyard.

Bluey: (whispering)There’s Brandy! Let’s see if she’s okay.

Chili: Yeah, she finally comes to visit and we let her get eaten by a cheetah!

Bluey: So rude!

Bingo peaks from behind the tree unknowingly to Bluey and Chili.

Bingo: (growls)

Brandy:(Whispering) No! Go back! Go back!

Chili: Huh?

Bluey: Is she shooing a fly?

Brandy: (Whispering)Run?

Bluey: Brandy, are you shooing a fly?

Brandy: Run, it’s a trap!

Chili & Bluey: Huh?

Bingo shows up and attacks Chili.

Bingo: (growls)

Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)

Chili: (laughs) Run, Bluey!

Bluey: Ahh!

Bingo chases after Bluey:

Bingo: (growling)

Chili & Brandy: (sigh)

Brandy: I tried to warn you.

Chili: We had to see if you were okay.

Brandy: Thanks, appreciate it!

Chili: Are you okay?

Brandy: Yeah, I will be.

Bingo is growling and chasing Bluey up and down a slide in the background while Chili and Brandy lay on the ground and talk.

Brandy: I’m sorry, Chili.

Chili: Oh, you couldn’t have known Bingo was bananas.

Brandy: No, I mean… I’m sorry it’s been so long.

Chili: Oh.

Brandy: It’s just hard seeing you all. You know?

Chili: I know.

Chili holds Brandy’s hand and they both smile while looking at some clouds.

Brandy: I tell you what, next time I come over, I’m not bringing any onesies.

They both smile at each other.

Bluey: Ahh, help!

Chili: We have to help Bluey!

Brandy: Let’s do the dance!

Chili: The one we did as kids?

Brandy: Yeah! Do you still remember the moves?

Chili: Well, with your help I can.

Bluey is running away from Bingo who is riding a bike.

Bluey: Ahh!

Bingo: (growls)

Bluey: Cheetahs can’t ride bikes!

Bingo crashes into the mailbox while Bluey runs towards Bandit who’s laying down next to the car on his phone.

Bluey: Dad, help!

Bandit: I can’t, I’ve been eaten. Rules are rules.

Bluey: But Bingo’s gonna eat me!

Bandit: Well, zebras are pretty good dodgers.

Bluey: Oh, yeah, they are!

Bandit: You have to become one with your onesie.

Bluey pretends to be a zebra while dodging Bingo’s attacks.

Bluey: (makes zebras noises)

Bingo: (growls while trying to attack her but misses) Reow?

Bluey continues to dodge until Bingo grabs her zebra tail and tries to escape.

Chili: Hey, Bingo!

Bingo: Reow?

Chili: (to Brandy) Ready? 1, 2, 3.

Chili and Brandy do the dance they used to do for their mum while laughing. Bluey and Bingo look at each other then smile and walk towards Chili and Brandy.

Chili: Yup, then this.

Bluey and Bingo laugh then join in on the dance,

Chili: (laughs) No, no, no, hips first.

Bluey: (laughs)

Bingo: (laughs)

Brandy: (laughs) Chili!

Chili: (laughs)

All four of them laugh while dancing.

Bluey: Dad! (rides her scooter offscreen)

Bingo: Can I have a piggyback?

Bandit: No, you can walk yourself. We're only going up to the river and back.

Bingo: Aw, that's too far.

Bandit: It's not too far.

Bluey: It's an itchity grub family.

Bingo: Ooh, hello, itchity grubs.

Bluey: They're out for a walk.

Bingo: I wonder if their legs get tired from walking too.

Indistinct talking can be heard in the background.

Bluey: Oh no.

The camera zooms out to reveal a mother with a stroller is on the footpath walking towards the girls and itchity grubs. The mother is listening to her phone.

Bingo: The little itchities will be hurt.

Bluey gasps.

Bingo: Excuse me, look out for the little itchity grubs.

Bingo: Thank you.

Bluey: Phew.

Chilli and Bandit walk onscreen. Bandit carries Bingo's scooter.

Chilli: Not far now, kids.

Bingo: Mum, I need a piggyback. I can't walk anymore steps.

Chilli: Oh, Bingo, (points to the pacifier) can you please run this back to that mummy?

Bingo: Okay.

Bingo picks up the pacifier. She and Bluey start walking back towards the mother. Bandit and Chilli continue to walk forward. The girls eventually catch up with them. Bluey rides her scooter as she passes Bandit and Chilli.

Bingo: I did it.

Chilli: Good girl, Bingo.

Bingo: (singing happily) Doot-do-do-do-do-do-do.

Bandit: Bingo, are your legs still tired?

Bingo stops walking and opens her eyes wide. Her face then becomes gloomy.

Bingo: Aww, yes.

Bandit: Aw, bummer. I wanted to give some of those pine cones to your mum.

Bingo: Ooh, I'll get 'em.

Bingo runs ahead of Bandit and Chilli, leaving them behind. When she gets to the pine cones, Bluey can be seen hitting a tree with a stick.

Bluey: Hey Bingo, give me a hand.

Bingo: Two seconds.

Bingo runs back towards her parents with the pine cones. She gives them to Bandit.

Bandit: Thanks, mate. She loves pine cones.

Bluey and Bingo jump out from behind the grill and frighten Chilli and Bandit. Chilli and Bandit set the girls' scooters down.

Chilli: Oh, you got us!

Chilli and Bandit chase Bluey and Bingo around the grill.

Bandit: Come here, you little pickles. (climbs on top of the grill) Come here, you.

Bandit jumps off the grill and grabs Bingo. Chilli grabs Bluey. They eventually set them down.

Bingo: Do that again.

Bluey gets on her scooter and rides away.

Bandit: Yeah yeah, on the way back.

Bingo: Aww, how much farther to the river?

Chilli picks up Bingo's scooter.

Bandit: Not far, come on. Let's keep going.

Bingo: But I can't keep going.

Chilli: Well, how about we play chariots? (she picks up a palm branch and wraps it around Bingo's scooter while she holds the two ends of the branch)

Bingo: Yeah, chariot!

Chilli gallops like a horse. Bingo giggles.

Bandit: Oh, come on. Heeya

Bandit hits Chilli in the back, making her speed up. She catches up to Bluey. Chilli neighs.

Bluey: I'm going to beat you, chariot!

Bingo: Oh no. I'll help you, horsey.

Bingo uses her foot to help the scooter speed up, but Bluey still passes them up as Chilli tires out. Chilli neighs.

Bluey: I win!

Chilli drops the palm branch.

Chilli: That's good exercise. Phew.

Bingo: Can I just have a teensy little piggyback?

Bandit: Nah, (he picks up Bingo's scooter) you'll miss out on too much fun stuff down on the ground.

Bingo: Oh, like what fun stuff?

Bluey: Dad, I'll race you to that bubbler.

Bandit: Okay. Bingo, can you say "Ready, set, go?"

Bingo: Yeah! Ready, set, goat.

Bluey and Bandit begin running forward, but Bingo interrupts.

Bingo: Hey, I didn't say "go", I said "goat".

Bandit: What? Goat? Bingo.

Bluey: Oh, Bingo.

Chilli laughs.

Bingo: Ready, set, go-anna.

Bluey and Bandit begin running forward again, but Bingo interrupts them again.

Bingo: Hey, come back. I didn't say "go" I said "go-anna". (giggles)

Bandit: Oh, not again.

Bluey and Bandit walk back to the start line. Before they reach the start line, Bingo signals them to go. Bluey is ahead of Bandit when Bingo signals them to go.

Bingo: (fast) Ready set go.

Bandit: What?

Bluey screams and starts taking off. Chilli laughs.

Chilli: Come on, Bingo. Not far to the river now.

Bingo walks forward, but becomes slow and eventually falls to the ground.

Chilli: Oh, Bingo.

Bingo: I need a piggyback.

Chilli: You know what I've noticed?

Bingo: What have you noticed?

Chilli: I've noticed that your legs don't get as tired when you're having fun.

Bingo: Ooh. (lifts her legs) Can I noticed that too?

Chilli: Sure can. Watch. Gingerbread Man!

The camera zooms in on Bingo's face. When it zooms out, she gets up and runs.

Bingo: Run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

The camera shifts to a front view of Bingo as she runs from Chilli.

Chilli: Stop, stop, little Gingerbread Man!

Bingo giggles. She runs past Bluey.

Bluey: Stop, stop, little Gingerbread Man. (she follows Bingo on her scooter) You look good to eat.

Bingo: I have run away from a little old woman and I can run away from you too, little old man.

Bluey gets off her scooter and starts running. Chilli grabs Bluey's scooter.

Bingo: Run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

Bingo giggles. She runs past Bandit, who is sitting on a bench. Bandit gets up, grabs Bingo's scooter, and chases Bingo.

Bandit: Stop, stop, little Gingerbread Man. I'm a friendly fox. I just wanna talk to you.

Bingo: Run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

Bingo makes it to the end of the footpath with a view of the river. She giggles.

Bingo: Ah, the riverbank.

Bandit: You did it, little Gingerbread Man. You made it all the way to the riverbank. Well done. Now pop on, I'll give you a piggyback home. (shakes his back) Your legs must be so tired.

Bingo: No, you'll just try to eat me. (giggles and runs around Bandit)

Bandit: Huh?

Bingo: Run, run as fast as you can. (runs away) You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man.

As Bingo runs away, Bluey runs onscreen.

Bluey: Is she gonna run all the way home?

Bandit: Ah, looks like it.

Chilli runs onscreen carrying Bluey's scooter.

Chilli: (panting) Come on, you lot, get after her.

Bluey: Yeah, it's good exercise. (runs away)

Chilli: Looks like her legs aren't tired anymore.

Bandit: I was gonna giver her a piggyback.

Chilli: Well, if there's one going. (jumps on Bandit's back)

Bandit groans. He strains as he carries Chilli.

Bluey: Hm!

Dad: Are you're STILL cranky with me?

Bluey: You said we could go to the library.

Dad: It was shut!

Bluey: You promised. And you shouldn't break your promise.

Dad: Yeah, I know, mate, but...

Mum: (SHOUT) Why is this panda puzzle not tidied up?!

Bluey: Uh-oh!

Dad: Quick! Hide!

Dad: Ohh! How interesting!

Bluey: Argh!

Dad: Did Bluey break her promise?

Bluey: Well, you broke YOUR promise, so I can break mine.

Mum: What?

Bingo: It's true. Dad broke his promise.

Dad: The library was shut!

Mum: Seems like we've got a promising problem.

Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!

Dad: OK, from now on, no-one makes any more promises.

Bingo: But you promised you'd always love us!

Dad: Whoa. I didn't think this through.

Mum: Listen, you can still make promises. You just have to keep them.

Bluey, Bingo and Dad: OK. Yeah.

Bluey and Dad: That makes more sense.

Bingo: Phew!

Dad: Bluey, from now on, we keep our promises. No matter what!

Bluey: No matter what. Well, goodnight, everyone!

Mum: Panda puzzle!

Bluey: Argh!

THE NEXT DAY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

DAD AND MUM LAUGH

Bluey: Dad, will you play Toddlers with us at the library?

Dad: I'll play anything with you at the library if you hurry up.

Bluey: Do you promise?

Dad: Wah.

AT CAFE

Bluey and Bingo: That was funny.

Dad: Yeah, yeah.

Mum: Well done for keeping your promise.

Dad:Thanks. Speaking of - Bluey, do you mind if I put my books in your book bag?

Bluey: Sure!

Dad: You promise you don't mind? It's only two books.

Bluey: Yeah, I promise.

Dad: Great! Here they are.

DAD PUT TWO BIG BOOKS ON THE TABLE

Bluey: What?!

Dad: Ha!

ALL WALKING ON FOOTPATH

Bluey: Wait up! These books are heavy!

Dad: Thanks, Bluey! You're your star.

Mum: OK, listen, you two. You can't use promises to trick each other.

Dad and Bluey: Ohh!

Mum: The whole point of promises is to build trust. If there's no trust, none of this is possible.

Bluey: What, none of the whole world?

Mum: None of it. No libraries, no roads, no power lines.

Bingo: No power lines?!

Bluey: I'm not sure about that. I think we'd still have power lines.

Mum: No, we wouldn't.

Dad: Mum's right. No more promise-y tricks.

Bluey: OK.

Bingo: Ooh! Can we play in the playground?!

Bluey: Yeah, please, can we?

The episode opens in the dining room. Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo are siting at the table, eating eggs on toast. Bluey is chewing with her mouth open.

Bandit: Bluey, come on, chew with your mouth shut.

Bluey: Sorry, Dad. I keep forgetting.

Bandit: That's OK.

Bluey immediately goes back to chewing with her mouth open.

Bandit: Bluey!

Bluey: Sorry!

Bandit: Well, if you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to...

Bandit reaches under the table, and comes up with the Unicorse puppet.

Bluey and Bingo: Unicorse!

Unicorse: How's it going, salad dodgers?

Bandit: Well, Unicorse, Bluey keeps chewing with her mouth open.

Unicorse glances from Bluey back to Bandit.

Unicorse: So? I chew with my mouth open all the time. Watch.

Unicorse picks something out of his mane and pops it in his mouth.

Unicorse: (chewing) Omf om om.

Bandit, Bluey and Bingo: (gasp)

Bandit: Did you just eat a tick from your own hair?

Unicorse: Yep.

Bandit, Bluey and Bingo: Eugh!

Bandit: You know what, kids, don't listen to Unicorse.

Unicorse: What? Why not?

Bandit: 'Cause you're a grub.

Bandit counts on his fingers.

Bandit: You don't brush your teeth, you don't eat vegetables and you don't take showers.

Unicorse: (burps)

Bingo and Bluey: (laugh)

Bandit: Grub.

Bluey: But that's why we like him. He doesn't care that he's a grub.

Unicorse: I'm happy with who I am. Why should I change?

Chilli enters.

Chilli: Morning, Bluebears.

The camera focuses on Unicorse, and does a dramatic dolly zoom on his face.

Unicorse: (gasp)

The camera cuts to a shot of Chilli walking into the kitchen. The shot is clearly from Unicorse's perspective - the shot is in soft focus, with side lighting, sparkles, and a noticeable pink tint. We cut back to the family at the dining room table.

Unicorse: Who is that?!

Bluey: That's our mum!

Unicorse: Well...

Unicorse licks his hoof, and slicks back his hair and horn.

Unicorse: I'm gonna marry your mum.

Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: What?!

Unicorse marches down the table. Bingo holds him back.

Bingo: (laughing) Stop! She's already married.

Unicorse: And... why should I care?

Bluey: You would care if you knew who she was married to.

Bandit: Yeah. He's a pretty smooth guy.

Unicorse: Not as smooth as me! Check it.

Cut to the kitchen. Chilli is loading the dishwasher. Unicorse pops up from below the countertop.

Chilli: (startled) Ooh!

Unicorse: (singsong) Hey, toots, when are we getting married?

Cut to a lower view of the kitchen, we can see the kids and Bandit lying on the floor.

Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)

Bandit: Mm, smooth.

Chilli: I'd say... never.

Unicorse: Hey, hey, hey! Check me out first.

Unicorse does a little dance that seems to be intended to show off his bum, if he had one. He has an orange stain on his back.

Chilli: Is that chilli sauce?

Unicorse: It's sweet chilli sauce. Care for a lick?

Unicorse sticks his stain in Chilli's face.

Chilli: Tempting, but no. You look like you've never cleaned your teeth, brushed your hair, or had a shower in your life.

Chilli closes the dishwater and walks off.

Unicorse: (sobbing)

Bandit: Well, you gave it a good shot. Now, I think you best be getting off.

Bandit starts to remove the puppet.

Bluey and Bingo: No, don't stop!

Unicorse: (suddenly determined) I ain't going nowhere until your mum and I are together.

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

Bandit: Oh, man.

Unicorse: What were all those things she said? Teeth combing and showuzz?

Bluey and Bingo: Showers

Unicorse: Whatever. Show me how to do 'em.

Bluey: OK, come with us.

Unicorse: Alright!

Unicorse pantomimes walking after them, but gets nowhere as Bandit is still lying on the floor.

Bandit: The thing is, I do this to myself.

TITLE CARD - Puppets

Unicorse: [voiceover] I don't know what that says, I can't read!

Cut to the bathroom. Unicorse is holding an electric toothbrush in both hooves, and Bingo is applying toothpaste for him.

Bingo: This is toothpaste.

Unicorse: Do I eat it?

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

Bingo: No! It makes your teeth clean.

Unicorse: What does this button do?

Unicorse pushes the button on the toothbrush, which begins to vibrate, spraying toothpaste everywhere.

Unicorse: Argh! Argh! Argh!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)

Cut to Unicorse in the shower, panicking and running in circles.

Unicorse: Argh! (continues shouting unintelligibly)

Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)

Cut to the kids' bedroom. Bluey is sitting on her bed, brushing Unicorse's hair.

Unicorse: Ow! Ow! Ow! That's it! You get the horn!

Unicorse turns around and tries to stab Bluey with his soft fabric horn.

Bluey: (giggles)

Cut to the dining room. Bluey puts a plate with a broccoli floret in front of Unicorse. Unicorse nibbles on it and spits it out.

Unicorse: (retching) Gah! Yuk!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)

Unicorse: (retching) Gah!

Bandit: Maybe self-improvement just isn't for you.

Bingo starts eating her own broccoli floret.

Bluey: Listen, Unicorse, no-one wants to eat broccoli.

Bingo: Except me.

Bluey: You just have to do it.

Unicorse: But why do I have to?

Bluey sets a photo of Chilli on the table. She is posing in front of the Sidney Opera House. She looks much younger - she has longer hair and almost no gray hairs in her coat.

Bluey: Because you want to marry Mum and she loves broccoli eaters.

Unicorse: Okay, let's do this.

Unicorse starts munching on the broccoli. Cut to the shower. Bluey is holding the photo. As the water is turned on, Unicorse screws up his face with effort.

Unicorse: (groans with effort).

Cut to the kids bedroom. Bluey is brushing Unicorse's hair; Unicorse is staring at the photo of Chilli.

Unicorse: Ow! (grunts)

Cut to the bathroom. Unicorse has got the toothbrush in his mouth this time, and Bingo is holding up the photo of Chilli for him. Toothpaste sprays everywhere when he turns the toothbrush on.

Unicorse: (grunts)

Cut to the green living room. Chilli is reading a magazine on the couch. Bluey and Bingo are peering at her from the stair railing. Cut to the stairs. Bandit and Unicorse are sitting on the stairs behind the kids. Unicorse's hair and horn are slicked back and shiny; his beard is braided, and he's wearing a little black bow tie.

Bluey: Okay, you're ready. Go and talk to Mum.

Unicorse: Okay. A quick tick for the road.

Unicorse rummages in his hair, but Bluey stops him before he can eat the tick.

Bluey: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You cannot eat a tick in front of Mum.

Bluey pantomimes grabbing the tick and flicking it to the floor.

Bluey: You got that?

Unicorse: Okay. Yep, got it.

Bluey: (pointedly) You got that, Dad?

Bandit: What's it got to do with me?

Unicorse: Yeah! What's it got to do with him?

Back at the couch, Chilli is still reading the magazine. Unicorse pops up from behind the couch.

Unicorse: Hi!

Chilli: (startled) Oh!

Unicorse: Oh, sorry, toot...I mean, love. I didn't mean to scare you.

Chilli: That's okay.

Unicorse: I've just stepped out of the show-ah and brushed my teeth.

Unicorse lunges forward with his mouth open to show Chilli his teeth.

Chilli (startled) Oh!

Unicorse: And I'm wondering, would you like to join me for some brocconi?

Unicorse produces a broccoli floret from somewhere.

Bluey: Broccoli!

Unicorse: Uh, I mean, broccoli.

Chilli puts down the magazine.

Chilli: Well, I must say, you really have cleaned yourself up. And I love your little bow tie. OK, yes, I'd love to.

Unicorse grabs a tick from his mane and eats it.

Unicorse: (munches)

Chilli: Oh, my gosh! (gags)

Chilli retches, and then runs out of the room.

Unicorse: No! Come back.

Chilli: (gags)

Unicorse wilts, laying his head on the couch. Bandit pops up from the floor.

Bandit: Well, that could have gone a bit better.

Bluey: Dad!

Bandit: What?

Unicorse: Oh, I'm sorry, kids. I couldn't help it.

Bingo: It's not your fault, Unicorse.

Bluey: Yeah, it's his.

Bandit: Me?!

Unicorse: Him? I don't understand. I'm the one who ate the tick.

Bluey: Unicorse, you're a puppet. He controls you.

Unicorse: (laughs) Ah, that's a good one.

Bandit: (laughs) Yeah.

Bingo: Dad.

Bluey: You are a puppet. I'll show you. Say something the exact same time as him.

Unicorse: Okay, we'll say "bauxite". You ready?

Bandit: Ready.

Unicorse: Bauxite!

Bandit: Bauxite!

Bluey and Bingo: See? Dad said it after!

Unicorse: Oh, he was just late. Try again.

Unicorse: Bauxite!

Bandit: Bauxite!

Unicorse: (laughs) He's just mucking around.

Unicorse smooshes Bandit's face.

Unicorse: That's why I love this guy.

Bluey: Dad, tell him the truth.

Bandit: Okay, okay. Look, mate, you are a puppet, and I do control you. I'm sorry.

Unicorse: (laughs) There he goes again.

Bluey: It's true. Have you ever looked at your legs?

Unicorse: What do you mean look at my legs? They're just normal.

Unicorse pulls up the hem of his torso, revealing Bandit's wrist.

Unicorse: (gasp)

Unicorse follows the wrist up Bandit's arm to his face.

Unicorse: My life is a lie.

Bandit: Yeah, and one more thing.

Bandit holds up a wedding photo of himself and Chilli.

Unicorse: (gasps) Oh!

Unicorse faints. Cut to the front porch. Bandit is reclining in a chair; Unicorse is sprawled over the arm of the recliner. His bow tie has fallen off. Chilli and the girls enter.

Chilli: Hi.

Unicorse: Oh, well, this won't be awkward.

Chilli: What are you doing?

Unicorse: Whatever he wants to do.

Bandit: Someone's feeling a bit sorry for themselves.

Unicorse: Someone? You're a someone! I'm a... no-one.

Chilli: (whispering) You ready?

The girls nod.

Chilli: (whispering) Go!

Bluey pulls the puppet off of Bandit's hand.

Bandit as Unicorse: Hey, hey, hey.

Bluey puts on the puppet.

Bluey as Unicorse: What's going on? Whoa, this feels weird.

Bluey transfers the puppet to Bingo.

Bingo as Unicorse: Whoa! This is amazing!

Chilli: You know what's good about being no-one?

Bingo as Unicorse: What?

Bingo transfers the puppet to Chilli.

Chilli: You're everyone.

Framed against the evening sun, Chilli gives Unicorse a kiss.

Chilli as Unicorse: Whoa!

Cut to the girls' bedroom at night. Bandit as Unicorse is tucking Bluey in.

Unicorse: Oh, crazy day.

Bluey: Shyeah.

Unicorse: I've been thinking. How can you be sure you're not a puppet?

Bluey: (giggles) Don't be silly. Night, Unicorse

Unicorse: Night.

Unicorse walks away. The camera pulls back through the fourth wall to show the scene in a CelAction2D window. Over the next 25 seconds, we see a timelapse of Joe Brumm's hand manipulating Bluey's model to animate the scene that follows. He renders a preview of the scene and presses play, and the camera zooms back in. It's now daytime. Bluey sits up and yawns.

Bluey: Wow, that was a weird dream.

[End credits]

The credits song is an alternate arrangement of the music from the animation dream sequence.

The episode opens on the front lawn of the Heeler house. Bandit and Bingo are leaving in the car, while Bluey and Chilli wave from the porch.

Bluey: Bye, dad!

Chilli: See you later!

Bingo: Bye!

Bandit honks the horn.

Bluey: See you Bingo!

Thunder rolls. Music featuring primarily plucked and strummed guitar begins to play. A heavy rain begins to fall. There is no further dialogue in the episode.

Chilli and Bluey glance at each other, then run off the porch.

Chilli carries a laundry basket to the side of the house and takes down the laundry. Bluey dances in the rain.

TITLE CARD - Rain

The title card shows three building blocks. No one reads the episode title. Instead, the rain and music continue.

The scene cuts back to Bluey dancing in the front yard, and Chilli taking down the laundry.

Cut to a dark blue rainy sky. Thunder rolls, the distant lightning illuminates the clouds.

Cut to the roof. Beads of water roll down the ridges in the metal roof.

Cut to the gutter. As drops of water from the roof turn into streams, the gutter fills and water flows to the downspout.

Cut to the base of the downspout. A trickle of water flows out, onto a splash block covered in leaves. The trickle turns into a gushing torrent, and water flows along the fence to the front walk.

Cut to the front lawn. Bluey is spinning around, trying to catch raindrops in her mouth. She notices the stream flowing down the front walk.

Bluey stops, and jumps into the stream, jumping over and over, then kicks the water to make a bigger splash.

She decides to block the water with her feet instead. The water builds up and flows around her feet, so she crouches down, and blocks it with her hand as well. As the water flows around her hand, Chilli finishes taking down the washing, and runs it to the front porch. She ducks inside the front door and comes back with an umbrella.

Chilli yells something to Bluey.

Bluey perks up and runs to get the umbrella. Back at the front walk, she opens the umbella, sets it down, and tries to use it to block the stream. Chilli notices, but lets it go.

Too much water flows into the umbrella and Bluey loses her grip. She tips out the umbrella, folds it up, and tosses it away. After looking around for a moment, she notices a plastic-wrapped newspaper.

She blocks the stream with her feet again, then uses the newspaper to extend her dam. As the water builds up, it pushes the newspaper out of the way. Bluey has an idea and runs off.

Back at the porch, Chilli walks out of the house and lays down on the deck chair. Bluey runs past her into the house, leaving a trail of puddles and leaves. Chilli gets back up, surprised.

Cut to the playroom. Bluey grabs a handful of building blocks, and runs back out.

Cut to the front door. Chilli freezes Bluey in her tracks with her Death Glare. They talk over each other. Chilli gestures with frustration at the mess on the floor, and then the door. Bluey excitedly points outside as she talks.

Chilli gestures at the mess again, and Bluey halfheartedly tries to clean up a puddle by rubbing it with her foot. Chilli gestures "out" by pointing her thumb over her shoulder, and Bluey runs outside.

Back at the front walk, Bluey straightens out the newspaper, then uses her blocks to build a longer dam. She holds the newspaper in place with her hands, but the blocks begin to wash away. Bluey puts her hands on her hips and considers the problem.

Chilli comes out on the front porch with a mop and towel. She sets the mop by the front door, and folds the towel on the porch. She points at the towel very emphatically.

Chilli sits back down in the chair. Bluey runs up on to the porch and grabs the towel, taking it out to the yard. Chilli looks shocked.

Bluey straightens up her dam, then rolls up the towel. She uses the rolled towel to reinforce the blocks. It works for a moment, but then the newspaper starts to wash away again. She moves the towel to hold the newspaper in place too - and a block starts to wash away. She thinks for a moment.

Cut to the laundry room. Chilli is grabbing another towel out of a cupboard. Bluey snatches it out of her hands and runs out, leaving a trail of puddles and leaves. Chilli protests.

Back at the the dam, Bluey rolls up the second towel and reinforces the newspaper. Her dam is less than halfway across the walk, and soon water is flowing past the edge again. Wordless vocals join the music. She uses her feet to extend the dam, then crouches down and uses both hands as well. The water still flows past.

Cut to the front porch. Chilli comes out the front door of the house, walking backwards while mopping up Bluey's trail of puddles. She spots Bluey running up the front walk.

Chilli desperately tries to block the front door. She leans sideways to block with her shoulder, then sits down and uses the mop to block Bluey as she tries to go low. She moves the mop side to side several times, blocking Bluey. Then Bluey gets her head under Chilli's arm.

The shot cuts the entrance, we see Chilli's back in the door. One of Bluey's arms and then the other pops past her barricade. Then her head pops free.

The shot cuts back to the porch, Chilli strains with effort as Bluey pumps her legs for traction.

Cut to a wider shot that contrasts the water flowing around Bluey's dam with Bluey squirming through her mother's blockade.

Cut to the entrance. Bluey squeezes past Chilli and runs inside; Chilli falls over backwards and lays there with her eyes closed.

In the playroom, Bluey picks up a dollhouse and runs back out.

In the entrance, she runs past Chilli, who is still laying in the doorway.

Back at the dam, Bluey adds the dollhouse to her construction.

Chilli sits back down on her chair. The music fades.

Chilli: (sighs audibly)

Chilli watches Bluey adjust her dam, as a new musical theme comes in, featuring bowed strings and harp.

Chilli's annoyed expression changes to a smile.

Cut to another shot of the sky. Thunder rolls, and distant lightning illuminates the storm clouds.

Cut to the roof. Water rolls down the ridges.

Cut to the gutter. Water pours down the hole to the downspout.

Cut to the downspout. Water gushes out onto the splash block.

Cut to Bluey's dam. She's extending the dam with her feet and hands again. Still, her dam is not quite long enough.

As the water is about to pass Bluey's fingertips, the music swells. Chilli's feet step into frame, extending the dam further.

Bluey cheers up noticeably. Chilli, holding an umbrella, just shrugs.

The dam is still not quite long enough. Bluey says something.

Chilli sighs, and discards the umbrella. She crouches down and uses her hands to extend the dam, finally reaching all the way across the walkway.

As the water nearly reaches the other side of the walkway, both their tails start to wag furiously -- but the rain stops, and the water is no longer advancing. The two look up at the sky.

Cut to the roof. The last few drops of water roll down.

Cut to the gutter. The last water flows down the hole to the drainpipe.

Cut to the drainpipe. The water slows from a gush, to a trickle, to drips.

Cut to the dam. The waters begin to drain away. Chilli and Bluey stand up, and hold out their hands to feel for raindrops. There are none. Bluey sighs, and Chilli puts her hand on Bluey's back, then pulls her in for a side hug.

The clouds part, and yellow sunlight illuminates the scene. Bluey notices something, and points toward the cul-de-sac. Chilli turns to look.

A double rainbow stretches across the sky.

Chilli and Bluey stare in awe. Chilli pulls Bluey in for another side hug, and their tails wag slowly.

The rainbow fades. Bluey turns and picks up the dollhouse. Chilli gestures dismissively, and Bluey puts it back down. The both walk towards the porch.

Thunder rumbles, and the light dims. They both look to the sky. The music dies down to just a harp.

Over the rooftop, storm clouds are illuminated by lightning.

Heavy rain begins to fall again.

Cut to the gutter, filling with water once again.

Cut the downspout. A trickles turns into a gushing torrent.

Cut to the front walkway . Chilli and Bluey hold out their hands to feel the rain. Water begins to stream down the front walk.

Bluey turns around to follow its progress, Chilli follows it with her eyes.

They make eye contact, and the music swells as they both run towards the dam.

[End credits]

The full arrangement of the episode music with all instruments plays during the credits. Bluey is replaced by the discarded umbrella.
