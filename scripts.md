Army
Jack: Mum!

Jack's mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!

Jack's mum: How was your first day at your new school?

Jack: Good.

Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.

Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.

Jack's dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?

Jack: Yes, Dad.

Jack's dad: Did you remember your hat?

Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?

Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!

(goat maahs)

Jack's dad: Jack, your hat?

Jack: I forgot it.

Jack's dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?

Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!

Jack's dad: Jaaaack.

Jack: Sorry, I forgot.

Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?

Jack: I don't know.

Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.

Calypso: Well, hello.

Calypso: You must be my new student.

Jack: I'm Jack.

Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.

Jack: Grr!

Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there. (the red kelpie Calypso is referring to is Rusty)

Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!

Jack's dad: You have fun, mate!

Jack: I will!

Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.

Jack: What are you playing?

Rusty: I'm playing army.

Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.

Jack: Can I be in the army?

Rusty: Well, maybe.

Rusty: Can you do as you're told?

Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...

Rusty: Attention!

Jack: Ah!

Rusty: On the left! Quick march!

Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: On the right!

Rusty: March! Hup-hup-hup halt!

Rusty: Salute!

Rusty: Yeah, you can play.

Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.

Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier.

Rusty: You have to go through basic training.

Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.

Rusty: That's me.

Jack: Oh. Ok.

Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?

Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.

Rusty: You can use my spare.

Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.

Jack: Yes sergeant.

Rusty: Hup!

Jack: Hup!

(both laugh)

Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.

Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.

Rusty: Stop!

(Jack showing hand signals)

Jack: This one means "stop!"

Jack: This means "get down!"

Jack: This is "move over there."

(Jack stops showing hand signals)

Jack: Ha!

Coco: I'll get it! Huh?

Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.

Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.

Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.

Jack: Also, everything had a name.

Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.

Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.

Rusty: That blue gem is called Tango Seven.

Rusty: You got that?

Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.

Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.

Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.

Jack: A dust-off?

Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.

Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.

Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.

Jack: Grunts (while doing push-ups)

Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.

Jack: It's when you're a guard.

Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.

Jack: I loved it.

Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.

Jack: I was really good at sentry.

Rusty: You're really good at sentry.

Jack: Thanks, Sarge.

Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.

Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.

Jack: How do you know so much about the army?

Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.

Jack: Is he on patrol like us?

Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.

Jack: Oh, that's good.

Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.

Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!

Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.

(Rustling in grass)

(Rusty gasps)

(Rustling continues)

Rusty: Contact!

Jack: What do we do?

Rusty: Fall back!

(Both say Arrgh)

(Turkey gobbles)

Rusty: Get down!

(Jack grunts)

Rusty: There's too many of them!

Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!

Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.

Rusty: (speaking into a dotted cylindrical object) Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded!

Rusty: Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?

Jack: It was all down to me.

Jack: I had to remember what that tree was called.

Jack: Tango Five?

Jack: No, Tango Six?

Jack: Tango Seven!

Rusty: (speaking into object once again) We're next to Tango Seven, over! (stops speaking into object)

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven.

Rusty: LZ is no good!

Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.

Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!

Jack: How?

Rusty: Run!

Jack: One thing I can do is run.

Jack: I'm a Jack Russell!

(Jack zooms by Rusty)

Rusty: Whoa!

Rusty: Get to the chopper!

Jack: Ok!

Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.

Jack: We made it!

Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.

(Both laugh)

Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.

Rusty: Why did you come to this school?

Rusty: Was there something wrong with your old school.

Jack: No.

Jack. There's something wrong with me.

Jack: I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.

Rusty: Oh.

Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.

Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso.

Rusty: You're all safe.

Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.

Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.

Jack: I was in the army.

Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.

Jack: And then it was pick-up time.

Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.

Jack: And now I'm here.

Jack's mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.

Jack: Yeah.

Jack's mum: Good boy, Jack.

Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?

Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?

Jack: Rusty gave it to me.

Rusty: See you, Jack!

Rusty's dad: Hey! Rusty!

Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.

Asparagus
Bingo, Bandit, Bluey, and Chilli are eating dinner in the dining room. Bluey is loudly chewing with her mouth open.

Bluey: (chewing) Agh! Agh! Glargh!

Bluey points at Bingo with her fork.

Bluey: (incomprehensible with her mouth full) Bla-bl-bl-blah, bl-bloo!

Bandit: Bluey, don't talk with your mouth full and sit up straight, don't slouch, it's bad manners.

Bingo: (with mouth full) Is this bad manners? Blaaaaaaaah.

Bingo sticks out her tongue, with a wad of chewed food on it.

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: (giggles)

Bluey: Mum, why do we have to have manners?

Bandit: Because we're not animals.

Chili: I'm happy as long you eat your veggies.

Bandit: Hey, hey, hey! Elbows off the table, thanks Mum.

Chili: (scoffs) Ha!

Bandit: Can you believe that, kids? Ha!

Bluey and Bingo: (giggles)

Chili: (whispering) Psst, Bluey, take this, it's a magic asparagus.

Bluey: What does it do?

Chili: It turns people into any animal you want!

Bluey: For real life?

Chili: For real life.

Chilli hands Bluey the asparagus.

Bluey: Ooooh!

Bandit: Don't play with your food! Blu--

Bluey: (pointing the asparagus like a magic wand) Donkey!

Bandit gets down on his hands and knees.

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw!

Others: (laughter)

Bluey: It worked!

Bandit: Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bingo: Do me! Do me!

Bluey: Okay. Warthog!

Bingo: No, no, I want to be a piglet.

Bluey: Piglet!

Bingo snorts, then jumps down from the chair and begins to run around the room on all fours.

Bingo: (imitating a pig) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Eeee! Eee!

Chilli: Now that's taken care of, I need you to do a little something for me.

Bluey: Chicken!

Chilli stands up so quickly she knocks over her chair, holding her arms like wings.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Ba-kaw!

TITLE CARD: Asparagus

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Asparagus.

END TITLE CARD

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo enter the kitchen together, still doing their animal impressions. Bluey runs in after them.

Chilli: (imitating a chicken) Bawk! Bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk!

Bingo: (imitating a piglet) Eee! Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bandit: (imitating a donkey) Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

Bluey: Elephant!

Bandit stands up, and holds his arm in front of his face like a trunk. Bingo runs through his legs and offscreen.

Bandit: (imitating an elephant) Vrooooo! Vrooooo!

Bluey: I love this!

Bingo runs through the scene, still imitating a piglet.

Bingo: Eee! Whee! Whee!

Bluey: Here, chook, chook, chook!

Chilli: (approaching with a chicken walk) Bawk-bawk-bawk, braawk!

Bluey: Goat!

Chilli gets down on hands and knees. She's drawn with buck teeth and a shorter tail.

Chilli: (imitating a goat) N-e-eh! N-e-eh!

Chilli walks offscreen, and Bingo runs through the scene again

Bluey: Now, be free, my animal friends. No more rules for anyone.

Bingo runs through the scene again, and this time there's a crashing noise from offscreen. The camera pans over to show Bingo digging through a cupboard. Potato chips and a can of beans are spilled on the floor.

Bluey: Aaah! Pig Bingo, you're making a mess!

Bluey grabs Bingo by the waist and drags her out of the cupboard. Bingo struggles as Bluey tries to hold her down.

Bluey: Come here you wriggly little--

Bandit enters from offscreen and picks Bluey up with his "trunk". Bingo immediately dives back into the cupboard.

Bandit: Vroooo!

Bluey: Aaaaaah! Put me down! Aaah! Meerkat!

Bandit stands up on his tiptoes, arms held in front of him.

Bandit: (imitating a meerkat) Um-dum-dum! Hey! Hey!

Bluey: You can't just grab people and swing them around!

Bandit scampers to the fridge on all fours, then stands up to look around.

Bandit: Hey, hey!

Back on all fours, Bandit scampers out of the room.

Bluey: (laughs)

A dog toy squeaks from offscreen. The camera pans, and shows Chilli leaning on the kitchen counter, nibbling on Polly Puppy.

Bluey: Polly Puppy! Mouse!

Chilli gets down on all fours and makes herself as small as she can.

Chilli: (imitating a mouse) Squeeeeak!

Bluey: You can't chew people's toys!

Chilli scratches her ear.

Bluey: It's not nice!

Chilli: Squeak! Squeak!

Bingo runs into the scene again, with an open bag of chips in her mouth.

Bingo: Eee!

Bluey: Penguin!

Bingo drops the chips, stands up straight with her arms at her sides and begins to waddle around.

Bingo: (imitating a penguin) De-de-de-de, de-de-de!

Bluey: (groans) This is hard work.

Bandit pops up from behind the kitchen counter.

Bandit: Um-dum-dum!

The scene changes to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo in, still doing their animal impressions.

Bluey: Maybe I'll turn you into slightly calmer animals. Peacocks!

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo stand up, lean forward, and hold their arms behind them.

Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo: (imitating peacocks) Prrrrr. Prrrrr. Prrrr. Rrrrr.

Bluey sits down on a chair.

Bluey: Ahh. That's a bit better.

Bandit snaps open a paper fan held behind him, imitating a peacock's tail.

Bandit: Prrrr-rrrr. Prrrr. Prrrr.

Bandit smugly waves his "tail" in Chilli and Bingo's faces. Chilli looks annoyed, Bingo looks confused.

Chilli and Bingo: Prrr. Prrrr.

Bluey: Hey, mind your manners, Mr. Show-Off!

Bandit struts, getting closer to Chilli and Bingo, who both look worried now.

Bandit: PRRRRR! Prrrr!

Bluey gets up and runs in between them. She pushes Bandit back a few steps.

Bluey: Okay, you asked for it. Lions!

Chilli and Bingo get down on all fours, adopting fierce expressions.

Chilli: (imitating a lion) Roaaaar!

Bingo: (imitating a lion) Rar!

Bandit jumps backwards a step.

Bandit: (worried) Prrrr!

Bluey: (laughs) That will teach you to show off!

Chilli and Bingo lunge at Bandit, and chase him out into the yard.

Chilli: Roaaaar!

Bingo: Rar! Rar!

Bandit: Prrrrr!

Bluey: Nooooo! Don't go outside!

The scene changes to the yard, at the base of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: (panting) Where'd they go!

Bandit: Prrrr!

The camera pulls back to show Bandit has climbed up onto the lowest branch of the paulownia tree.

Bluey: There you are! Walrus!

Bandit falls out of the tree.

Bandit: Aaaaah! Oof! (groans)

The camera pulls back to show the whole yard. Bandit is now laying on his stomach. He blinks one eye and then the other.

Bluey: Now, where are those lions?

The camera pans to show Lucky's Dad's yard, which is partially un-mowed. The un-mowed portion has waist-high grass. Pat is is singing while hanging shirts on a drying rack.

Pat: (singing) One Sunday morning as I went walking/By Brisbane waters, I chanced to--

A twig snaps.

Pat: Oh! What was that?

The camera cuts to show Chilli and Bingo, hiding in the tall grass.

Chilli and Bingo: (growling) Mmmmmmmmm. Graar!

The camera cuts back to Pat.

Pat: Is that you, Lucky?

The camera cuts to a wide shot of the yard. Chilli and Bingo are not visible. The only sound is crickets chirping.

Pat: Oh, well, I guess it's nothing.

Chilli and Bingo pounce from the tall grass, tackling Pat around the legs.

Chilli and Bingo: Roaaaar!

Pat: Aaaah!

The camera cuts back to Bluey and Bandit. Bandit is now doing a walrus impression, holding himself up on his arms and with two protruding teeth like tusks. He continues blinking his eyes one at a time. Bluey is down on all fours, presumably trying to tell him something.

Pat: (continues screaming from offscreen) Janelle!

Bluey gets up and runs out of frame.

Bandit: (imitating a walrus) Mwoaaaar!

The camera cuts back to Pat's yard. Chilli and Bingo are gnawing on Pat's ankles and dragging him into the tall grass. He's digging his fingers into the ground to stay put but it's not helping.

Pat: Oh, Mrs. Heeler! Oh, I don't know about this! Aah!

Bluey emerges from the tall grass.

Bluey: Parrot!

Bingo crouches down and folds her arms at her sides like wings. Chilli continues to chew on Pat's ankle.

Bingo: (imitating a parrot) Squawk!

Bluey: Bunny!

Chilli crouches down with her arms in front of her.

Chilli: (imitating a rabbit) (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Polly want a cracker?

Pat crawls to the safety of the drying rack, panting.

Bluey: Get back in the house, you two!

Bluey herds Bingo and Chilli back towards their yard.

Bluey: Sorry Lucky's Dad!

Pat: No worries Bluey. (sounding ashamed) I shouldn't have let my guard down.

The scene changes back to the playroom. Bluey herds Chilli, Bingo, and Bandit into the room.

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Get in here, you lot!

Chilli: (clicks her tongue repeatedly)

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: That's it! You animals need to learn some manners.

Bandit butts his head into Bluey's shoulder.

Bandit: Rohh!

Bluey: Aah! Daddy Walrus! No doing that thing!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: First manners is...

Bingo: Polly want a cracker.

Bluey: (pointing at Bingo) Oh! First is, don't speak when someone's speaking!

Bingo: (sadly) Squawk.

Bluey: Second manners is...

Chilli: (clicks her tongue)

Chilli wanders off, hopping like a bunny.

Bluey: Hey! Worm!

Chilli stretches out and starts writhing from side to side.

Chilli: (imitating a worm) Eee! Mmmmmn! Mmmmn!

Bluey: No running away from manners lessons! Now, third one is... don't eat the next-door neighbors. That's a really important one. Hey, where's Daddy Walrus?

Bandit is missing. Bluey gasps, and Bandit grunts from offscreen. The camera cuts to the corner of the playroom, where Bandit is squatting on the rug in in front of a dollhouse, a look of intense concentration on his face.

Bluey: Nooooo!

Bluey puts her hands on her face as she screams, causing her to toss the asparagus, which lands by Bingo. Bluey runs out of frame towards Bandit.

Bingo: (looking at the asparagus) Squawk!

The scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey in the corner. Bandit is squinting with effort. Bluey runs in between him and the dollhouse, and pushes him away.

Bandit: (grunts)

Bluey: Fourth manners is--

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: don't go to the toilet on the rug!

Bluey pushes him back to the others. Bingo is chewing on the asparagus.

Bluey: (groans with effort) You big grub!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: This is hopeless. I'm gonna turn you all back into dogs. Where's my asparagus?

Bingo: (indistinctly) Polly want a cracker!

Bingo swallows the asparagus whole.

Bluey: Noooooooo!

Bluey runs over to Bingo, and pries her jaws open as far as she can.

Bingo: Daaaaah.

Bluey lets Bingo close her mouth.

Bluey: Oh, no! You're stuck like this forever!

Bandit headbutts Bluey in the shoulder again.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bingo: Squawk! Polly want more asparagus!

Bluey: Wait! I've got an idea!

The scene cuts to a close-up of Bingo, still imitating a parrot, seated at the dinner table.

Bingo: Squawk!

The camera cuts back to reveal Bandit, slumped over and barely on his chair, with Bluey supporting most of his weight. Chilli is sitting upright in her chair, but only because she's been tied in place with a jump rope.

Bandit: Mwoaaar!

Bluey: Okay, Bird Bingo, you've eaten the magic asparagus. Too late to change that. But I think if you say "doggie," everyone will turn back to doggies.

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey: Can you say "Polly want a doggie"? Pretty please?

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Chilli: Mmmmn!

Bingo: Polly want a cracker!

Bluey: Ugh! No, "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit slaps Bluey with his "flipper".

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! Hands to yourself, Daddy Walrus! Come on, Bird Bingo! "Polly want a doggie"!

Bandit: Mwoaaaar!

Bluey manages to push Bandit upright in his chair.

Bluey: Oof!

Bandit, balanced precariously, teeters for a moment.

Bandit: Mwoar!

Bandit overbalances and falls out of his chair.

Bluey: Ugh!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bluey runs over and starts trying to lift Bandit into his chair again.

Bluey: Urgh! Come on, Bird Bingo! It's hard to get a walrus...

Bluey gets Bandit back into his chair.

Bluey: ...to sit at the dinner table!

Bingo: Polly want a... d... d...

Bluey: Yeah, yeah!

Bingo: Dinosaur!

Bandit and Chilli hold their arms in front of their chests like a T-Rex and snarl. Chilli is still tied to her chair.

Bandit and Chilli: (imitating a dinosaur) Roaaar! Roaaar!

Bluey: Aah! Bingo, no! Doggie, doggie!

Bluey shakes Bingo for a second, before Bandit picks Bluey up and pretends to chomp on her stomach.

Bandit: Roaaar!

Bluey: Aaah! No eating your manners teacher!

Bandit: (still chomping) Raar! Raar!

Bluey: (screams)

Bingo: Polly want a...

Bluey: Help!

Bingo: Polly want a... doggie!

With a jerk, Bandit and Chilli return to normal.

Chilli: Huh?

Bluey: Hooray! You did it, Bird Bingo!

Bingo: Squawk!

Bandit: What's going on?

Bluey: Uh...

Chilli: (untying herself) Oh, uh... We're just eating dinner. Remember?

Bandit: Ah, yeah -- dinner. Okay, well, make sure you --

Bluey eats her last two pieces of broccoli in one bite.

Bluey: (formally) I've finished my vegetables, Father. I shall now excuse myself to go tidy the kitchen.

Bluey pushes in her chair and clears away her dishes. She winks at Chilli on the way past, and Chilli winks back.

Bluey: Pip, pip!

Bandit: Well. That's more like it.

Bingo: (still imitating a parrot) Squawk! Bawk, bawk, bawk!

Bingo pecks at her food, causing the plate to rattle loudly.

Bandit: Bingo, for the last time, use a knife and --

Bingo: Chicken!

Bandit stands bolt upright and holds his arms like wings.

Bandit: (imitating a chicken): Ba-kaw!

BBQ

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Chilli [angrily from off]: Whose muddy footprints are these?!

Cut to Bingo using the mop to clean up her footprints. Later, Muffin and Socks have cleared the salad and dressing off the bench to make way for Bluey's "sausages".

Muffin: More sausages please, Bluey.

Bluey: Here you go.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Bandit: Out of the way, salads!

Bandit pushes the salad bowls aside to make room for the sausages. Everyone except Bingo and Bandit starts complimenting Bandit on the sausages.

Bandit: Why thank you. Thank you very much.

Bingo, however, is frustrated.

Bingo [annoyed]: Isn't anyone going to mention the salads??

Pause. Everyone looks around nervously, before starting to praise Chilli and her salads.

Chilli [laughing]: Thank you, thank you.

They all laugh, Stripe affectionately rubbing the top of Bingo's head. Chilli hugs Bingo.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

[Theme song]

The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.

Bandit: Ugh, come on!

Bluey: Oh, come on!

Bandit: Come on, start!

Bluey: Start! Come on!

Bandit: Come on, you heap of junk!

Bluey: Come on! Heap of junk!

The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.

Bluey: Whoosh!

Bluey and Bandit: There it goes.

TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!

Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.

Chilli [to Trixie]: (laughs) You've got to.

Bandit [to Stripe]: And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, "It's dog versus sheep."

Stripe: Oh, wow.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks

Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.

Bingo: There, table set.

Bluey: Almost ready with the sausages, kids.

Muffin: I love sausages!

Socks: (barks excitedly)

Bingo: This is my relaxer chair. It's where I relax.

Bingo sits on her chair.

Bingo: Ah! So relaxing.

Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.

Chilli [to Trixie]: Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going "Oh! Oh!"

Muffin looks over at the salad.

Muffin: We have to have salad with our barbecue!

Bluey: You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?

Bingo: Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but ok.

On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.

Bandit: Whew! That sun is hot!

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo: Ok, this is the salad bowl.

Bingo sits back down in her chair.

Muffin: You need to put salad in it!

Socks: (growl-like barks)

Muffin: I like capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad!

Bluey: Ooh, me to! I love capsicum (pepper on Disney)!

Socks: (barks) Gleen catsimun (peppah on Disney).

Muffin: Socks says she likes green capsicum (pepper on Disney) the best.

Bingo: (sighs) Uh, ok. I can get green capsicum (pepper on Disney). Green is easy.

Bingo runs over so some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.

Bingo: Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go.

She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.

Bingo: Eek! Bug!

The bug lands on Bandit's nose.

Bandit: And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!

Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.

Bingo: Oh, this one's ok.

Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.

Bingo: There. Green capsicum (pepper on Disney) salad.

She sits down in her chair again.

Bingo: Ahhh, so relaxing.

Bluey: Can I have some yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney)? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: Hmm, yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.

Bingo: Almost...

Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.

Bandit: He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep.

Stripe: Oh, no way.

Bingo: Just borrowing this, Dad.

Bandit: Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck...

Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.

Bandit: Hey!

Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.

Bingo: It's so heavy! There.

Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.

Chilli: That's not safe, Bingo.

Bingo: Aah! Aah! Mum!

Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.

Bingo: Ooh!

Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.

Bandit: And then- hey!

Stripe: (laughs)

Bandit: Bingo!

Bingo: Got it! Sorry, Dad.

Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.

Bingo: Here you go. Yellow capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Socks: (happy barks)

Bingo: Now I'm gonna relax.

Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums," or "peppers" on Disney. Note that Disney has changed "capsicum to "pepper" to avoid confusion.

Muffin: My favourite capsicum (pepper on Disney) is red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Bingo: Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)?!

Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.

Bingo: There's no red plants around, though, Muffin.

Muffin: Yes, there is. In that tree.

Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.

Bingo: Oh yeah! The poinciana!

Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.

Bingo: Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum (pepper on Disney)!!

She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.

Bandit: I mean- (grunts)

Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.

Bandit: Bingo! What are you doing?

Bingo [yells from the backyard]: I'm making a salad!!

Bandit [backing off]: Ok!

Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.

Bingo: Yaa! Yeah!

Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.

Bingo [panting]: There. Red capsicum (pepper on Disney).

Muffin: Yeah!

Bingo [panting]: I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum (pepper on Disney) left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair...

Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.

Trixie: Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

Chilli: Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe.

Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.

Muffin: We need salad dressing!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo [exhausted]: Ughhhhh, ok.

Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.

Stripe: So what did you do?

Bandit: Well...

Bingo: Can I borrow this, Dad?

Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.

Bandit: Hey!

Stripe: (chuckles)

Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.

Bingo: Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more.

Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.

Bingo: Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?

She keeps trying.

Bingo: Dad!

Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.

Bandit: Yes, Bingo?

Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.

Bingo: Don't worry, I got it working!

Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.

Bingo: There, now I'll fill up my jar.

She goes to put the hose down.

Bingo: I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!

The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.

Muffin: It's raining!

Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.

Stripe: Bingo, what are you doing down there??

Bandit: Bingo, grab the hose!

Bingo: I'm trying!!

Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.

Bingo: It's tickling my bottom!

Bandit: Forget the hose!

Stripe: Turn off the tap!

Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.

Bandit: No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!

Bingo: Got it!

Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.

Bingo: My goodness. This is not relaxing.

Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.

Bingo [frustrated]: Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!

Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.

Muffin: Thank you.

Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.

Bingo: Phew, finally! I get to relax!

Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.

Bandit: Sausages are ready!

Bluey and Muffin: Sausages!

Socks: (howls)

Bingo: Oh.

Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it. Chilli finishes placing the salads down when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.

Chilli: Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.

Bingo: Om-yum-yum!

Bluey: Mum, am I better at the monkey bars than Bingo?

Chilli: Well, you are two years older than her, Bluey.

Bluey: Am I better than Judo?

Chilli: You're about the same as Judo.

Bluey: I'm not! Judo cant do skip bar or backwards one bar.

Chilli: Well, she'll get there one day.

Bluey: But am I better than her on this day?

Chilli: Bluey, just run your own race.

Bluey: Huh? What does that mean?

Chilli: Come here. Have I told you the story of when you took your first steps?

Bluey: Oh, no!

Chilli: Well, it all started when you were still a baby.

(The camera shows a baby version of Bluey. She is wearing a red nappy and is lying on the floor, drooling on the rug, making baby noises)

(Bandit is also here too and he is drooling like Baby Bluey, Chilli is then see holding a baby rattle to catch Baby Bluey's attention.)

Chilli: Come on, Bluey. Roll over. Rollover! (Baby Bluey stops drooling, sees her mom and rolls over to one side)

Chilli (present): You learned to roll over really early. (Baby Bluey coos as we see a first person view of herself.)

Chilli (past): BANDIT!!! She rolled over!! She rolled over!! She's not meant to do that for ages!!

Bandit: Aw, that's my girl!

(Baby Bluey pushes Bandit to the side, she then laughs)

Bingo: Hang on, where was I?

Chilli: You weren't born yet, sweetheart.

Bingo: Ooh, I was invisible!

Bluey: Were you proud of me for rolling over so soon?

Chilli: Yes. A little too proud. (The camera goes to Nana's house. Bandit is seen dragging Baby Bluey to change her nappy while Nana and Chilli have some tea). I think I may have turned into a bit of a show off.

Nana: Oh, I've never heard of a baby rolling over that early!

Chilli (past): I know!

Nana: She's just special.

Bandit (past):(he coughs, the camera goes to mothers group where we see baby versions of Coco, Snickers and Judo. All of them are looking at their mums happily while making sounds. )

Chilli: But then one day at Mothers' Group...

Chilli (past): It is very early to roll over.

Bella: Oh, you're so clever, Bluey! (The look to their right and noticed something. We pan to see Snickers and Judo. Judo is the one who is sitting up while Snickers is seen laying down on the ground)

Wendy: Woah! She's sitting, She's sitting! Oh, Judo, you're sitting all by yourself! (Baby Judo giggles)

Snickers' mum: Oh, goodness, that's very early to be sitting!

Wendy: Oh, well, you know, it's not a race.

Bluey: But it was a race.

Bingo: A baby race!

(Episode title card)

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Baby Race.

(We go to another flashback. Chilli is seen holding Baby Bluey in her hands while Bandit is seen working on something)

Chilli: I don't know what got into me, but I was determined I'd get you walking before Judo's mum...I mean, Judo.

Chilli (past): There you go...steady...Bandit! She's sitting!

Bandit (past): Huh? Ack!

Chilli (past): Good gi-ah! (Baby Bluey suddenly falls down on the ground. She laughs very loudly)

(We go back to mother's group. This time the babies are sitting up, just like Baby Bluey).

Chilli: But after a lot of practice, eventually, you set up.

Bella: Bluey, you're sitting!

Baby Bluey: (she laughs, the two noticed Judo again. This time she is crawling while Wendy tries to catch up with her)

Wendy: Judo! Oh, goodness, I just can't keep track of her!

Baby Bluey: (mumbles, she then falls and laughs)

Bluey: Judo crawled before me as well?!

Bingo: Judo beat you again!

Bluey: And just what did you do about this?

Chilli: Well, I tried my best.

Bandit (past)(background): This thing is heavy!

Chilli (past):(claps) Come on, Bluey, crawl to Mama! You can do it, you can do it!

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did Bluey crawl?

(Baby Bluey rolls across the floor, she then laughs again)

Chilli: Not exactly.

Bluey:(laughs) Why was I rolling?

Chilli: I don't know, kid. You didn't come with instructions.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just roll before they crawl.

(Baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton dog and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Bandit (past)(background)(singing): 99 bottles of thing on the wall...

Chilli (past): Aha!

(Cut to living room area)

Chilli (past): It's fun to crawl. (Baby Bluey giggles as she sees this) Oh, how good is crawling? It's better than rolling.

Bandit (past): (falls on Bluey's toy) YOW! My knees! Baby Bluey laughs very loudly)

Bluey: Did I do it?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Chilli: Not exactly.

Chilli (past): Come on, Bluey! You can do it! Crawl to me!

(Baby Bluey looks like she's going to crawl, but then bum shuffles to Chilli as she giggles to her)

Bandit (past): Woo hoo, yeah! Bum shuffle!

Bluey: Bum shuffle?!

Chilli: Bum shuffle.

(Cut to Mothers' Group where Baby Bluey is seen bum shuffling to meet her baby friends)

Chilli: You were a bum shuffler.

(As Baby Bluey bum shuffles, Coco is seen crawling to the right and to the left, Snickers is about to crawl, but he sees Baby Bluey bum shuffling and Judo is seen getting on top of a stool)

Bella: Woo hoo! Go Bluey!

Chilli: Meanwhile, Judo was pulling herself up on furniture, which is the step right before walking.

Bluey: And I was just bum shuffling around?!

Bingo: You are definitely not winning the baby race.

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about.

Doctor: Some babies just bum shuffle before they crawl.

(Again, baby Bluey crashes into the skeleton and laughs)

Chilli: But I wasn't having that.

Chilli (past): See, feels good, doesn't it? Feels like you wanna crawl, right?

Bingo: Did she crawl?

Mum: Yes!!

Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!!

Chilli: Backwards! (Baby Bluey suddenly crawls backwards as she giggles)

Bandit (past): (laughs) Beep, beep, beep!

(Bingo laughs while Bluey facepalms)

(Cut to doctor's office)

Chilli: The doctor said there was nothing to worry about. (Baby Bluey giggles again)

(Cut to Nana's house)

Chilli: But Nana wasn't having that.

Nana: Let's stop mucking around, eh? A bit of olive oil on those knees will do the trick.

Chilli (past): But how is olive oil gonna-oh my goodness!

Bandit (past): Mum, what are you doing?!

Nana: If she can't crawl, she'll have to walk.

Bandit (past): This isn't legal anymore!

Nana: I'll sprinkle some grit down, too. Oh, where'd they go?

(Bluey and Bingo laugh)

Chilli: Your Nana's old school.

(Cut to Mothers' Group, this time the Babies, expect for Bluey, who is still crawling backwards are walking. Baby Snickers suddenly falls on his butt.)

Chilli: None of it mattered, though. Judo had won the baby race.

(Cut to present)

Bingo: Oh, biscuits.

Bluey: Were you upset with me that I lost the baby race?

Chilli: No, sweetie. Look, we were all learning to do things for the first time.

(Cut to balcony)

Chilli: I just felt like I was doing everything wrong.

Bandit (past): Aren't you going to Mothers' Group?

Chilli (past): (sighs)

(Cut to Mothers' Group. While Wendy and Snicker's mum talk about the hat that Snickers usually wears, Baby Coco makes a sound, shocking and distracting Bella.)

Snickers' mum: It's a cute hat, It's kinda like he was born with it.

(Cut to porch. Bella is seen holding her purse and Baby Coco as Baby Bluey plays with leaves.)

Chilli: But then, one day, Coco's mum came to see me.

Bella: Hi, Chilli.

Chilli (past): Bella! Oh, hello. I'm so sorry, the house is a mess.

Chilli: We chatted for a while and then she showed me a photo.

Chilli (past): Are these all your children?

Bella: Yep!

Chilli (past): I thought Coco was your first.

Bella: No, I've got eight kids! Wait, no. Nine.

Chilli (past): I had no idea! Wow... you must have learned a thing or two.

Bella: I have. And there's something you need to know.

Chilli (past): What?

Bella: You're doing great.

(Chilli tears up and embraces Bella. Cut to present.)

Chilli: (sniffles)

Bingo: Are they happy tears, Mum?

Chilli: (voice breaking) Yeah. Happy tears, honey.

(Cut to living room)

Chilli: From then on, I decided to run my own race.

Chilli (past): Whoa, whoa, whoa, yay! Bluey wins!

(Cut to Mothers' Group, Judo walks up to Chilli as she makes a sound)

Baby Judo: Oobi!

Chilli (past): Well done, Judo, you clever girl! (We show a close up of Baby Judo, there is a pink bow on her head and there are hearts on her diaper.)

Bingo: So, did Bluey ever learn to walk?

Chilli: Yes, honey. In the kitchen, actually.

(Cut to kitchen, Bluey pulls herself up and walks to Chilli)

Bluey: Why did I decide to walk in the kitchen?

Chilli: I don't know, sweetie.

(As the episode nears its end, Chilli sees Baby Bluey walking and reaches to pick her up with tears in her eyes.)

Bingo: Maybe you just saw something you wanted.

The episode starts at Calypso's school. The shot cuts to the main classroom, where all the pups are gathered around by Calypso.

Calypso: "Okay class, something very special is happening today!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "What is it?"

Bluey and Mackenzie look at each other after saying the same thing in unintentional unison. Winton scoots up next to Bluey.

Winton: "Oooh! Bluey's gonna marry Mackenzie!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "No we're not!"

Calypso: "You're going to see your buddies!"

The Pups: "Hooray!"

Calypso: "Now, go to the special place where you meet them."

The pups laugh as they all run off. The shot cuts to Bluey running to her buddy, sitting on a hill resting underneath a tree.

Bluey: "Mia!"

Mia: "Bluey!"

Mia and Bluey hug each other.

Bluey: "Can we build a fairy garden?"

Mia: "Okay, let's go!"

The shot cuts to Mackenzie meeting his buddy.

Mackenzie: "Captain!"

Captain: "Mackenzie!"

The two do a unique handshake.

Mackenzie: "Can we play barky boats?"

Captain: "Okay!"

EPISODE TITLE: Barky Boats

Calypso: "This episode of Bluey is called Barky Boats."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia, who run down the hill, joyfully laughing.

Bluey: "Mia? Can I show you my cartwheel?"

Mia: "Go for it!"

Bluey proceeds to do a cartwheel, impressing Mia.

Mia: "Wow! You've been practicing! Watch mine!"

Mia does her cartwheel, landing in a split.

Bluey: "Whoa!"

Mia: "Come on! I'll race you!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Mia race after one another, heading to the forest where their fairy garden resides. The shot cuts to Mackenzie and Captain sitting by a small pond canal. Mackenzie grabs some wood bark chips scattered about the ground.

Captain: "I'll make the dam!"

Mackenzie: "Here's a good one!"

Captain: "Oh yeah, that'll go fast!"

Just then, Bluey and Mia run by as Mackenzie is busy sharpening a bark chip to refine the shape.

Captain: "Hi Mia. Hi Mia! HI MIA!"

Mia: "Oh! Hi Captain!"

Captain: "What are you up to?"

Mia: "Bluey and I are gonna go build a fairy garden. What are you doing?"

Captain: "We're playing barky boats!"

Mia: "Oh, okay. Have fun. Bye!"

Captain: "Bye, Mia!"

Bluey and Mackenzie stick their tongue out at each other, showing they have a light rivalry with one another. After Bluey and Mia leave, Mackenzie runs back with the barky boat.

Mackenzie: "Okay, let it go!"

Captain moves his hands away from the dam, causing the water to flood out as the barky boat travels down the canal.

Mackenzie & Captain: "Yeah! Look at it go!"

The boat reaches the end, a wave of new water overlapping with the pond at the end of the canal.

Mackenzie: "Again!"

Captain: "Hey, uhh, Mackenzie? Do you wanna help Bluey build a fairy garden?"

Mackenzie: "...No?"

Captain: "Ah, okay."

The shot cuts to Bluey and Mia in the forest, running to a secluded space with a small stream of water running through.

Bluey: "Let's build it here!"

Bluey grabs a log, and Mia grabs a couple leaves.

Bluey: "This can be the bridge."

Mia: "These can be the trees!"

Bluey and Mia do more work on the fairy garden, setting up houses out of the resources around the forest. Mia helps Bluey pick a couple plants off of the trees, and then the shot cuts to a more complete fairy garden.

Bluey: "How old are you?"

Mia: "Twelve!"

Bluey: "Wow. Can you drive a car?"

Mia: "Hehehe! No, not yet!"

Bluey: "When do you start big school?"

Mia: "Next year."

Bluey: "Are you nervous about big school?"

Mia's smile slightly drops into a worried frown.

Mia: "No, it's gonna be great!"

Bluey: "Ooh, can you write words?"

Mia: "Yeah!"

Bluey: "Can you write a letter to the fairies?"

Mia: "Okay, go for it!"

Bluey: "Okay, um. Dear fairies--"

Mackenzie and Captain enter, alerting Bluey and Mia.

Captain: "Hi!"

Bluey: "Aah! Ugh, Mackenzie, what are you doing here?"

Mackenzie: "He made me come!"

Mia: "Explain yourself!"

Captain: "Oh, I...I thought there might be some good bark here for our barky boats."

Bluey: "Well, there's not, now shoo!"

Mackenzie: "I told you! Come on, let's go!"

Mia: "Bye!"

Bluey: "Ugh, that was close! Okay, dear fairies: Dad bought new grass, but it had ants in it, and he couldn't find the ant powder, and Mum was like 'Where'd you last have it?' He said--"

Mia gets sidetracked and pulls up a piece of bark.

Mia: "Oh! Look! Do you think this would make a good barky boat?"

Bluey: "Uhhh, I guess?"

Mia: "Do you just wanna just quickly give it to Mackenzie?"

Bluey: "No!"

Mia: "Come on Bluey, I'll race you!"

Mia runs off, but Bluey hesitantly waits behind, worried she's leaving her behind to hang out with Captain and Mackenzie. The shot cuts back to the two other buddies, playing another round of barky boats.

Mackenzie: "Keep letting the water build up!"

Captain: "Okay."

Mackenzie: "And no running off!"

Captain: "Yeah, okay. I don't know what I was thinking."

Mia enters, alerting the two.

Mia: "Hi!"

Captain: "Aah!"

Captain jumps, scared by Mia's sudden appearance. causing the built-up water to flood out, splashing Mackenzie in the face.

Mackenzie: "Aah!"

Captain: "Sorry, Mackenzie!"

Bluey enters, looking annoyed.

Mackenzie: "What are you doing here?!"

Bluey: "She made me come.."

Mia: "I thought you might like this barky boat?"

Captain: "Aw, thanks! That's a good one!"

Mackenzie: "It's not that good.."

Bluey: "It's gooder than yours!"

Mackenzie: "Is not!"

Mia: "I can find a better one!"

Captain: "I'll help you."

Mia: "Okay!"

Mia & Captain: "We'll be right back!"

The two run off, leaving Bluey and Mackenzie alone.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Awww..."

Some time passes, Bluey and Mackenzie sulk by the barky boats pond. Just then, Calypso enters!

Calypso: "Aw, Bluey! Mackenzie! Where are your buddies?"

Bluey: "They ran away from us!"

Calypso: "Oh, goodness me."

Bluey: "Don't they like us?"

Calypso: "Of course they do! But, it can be hard being twelve years old, sometimes."

Bluey: "What do you mean?"

Calypso: "Here, give me those barky boats. I'll show you something. Go on, hold the water back."

Bluey and Mackenzie both hold the water back, causing it to build up.

Calypso: "There once were two six year-old buddies floating around, nice and calm, not a care in the world! They turned seven years old, then eight years old, then nine, then ten, and eleven, and then...!"

Mackenzie: "I can't hold it any longer!"

Bluey: "Look out!"

The two let go of the dam, causing the water to flood out at high speeds and for the two barky boats to go travelling down.

Calypso: "Twelve! Off they went, on a big adventure! Hang on, buddies!"

Bluey & Mackenzie:' "Yeah, hang on, buddies!"

Calypso: "They went this way, and that way..."

The boats begin to drift due to the surging rush of water, with them coming close to falling out.

Mackenzie: "Aah! Are they gonna make it?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

The barky boats continue down the canal, before finally landing in the pond at the end of the path safely.

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Yeah! They made it!"

Calypso: "Hooray!"

Bluey: "And they lived happily ever after."

Calypso: "Just be patient, children. Your buddies haven't forgotten you."

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Okay, Calypso!"

Now back with Captain and Mia, they walk into a empty part of the forest, with a fruit tree.

Mia: "Maybe there's some barky boats around here."

Captain: "Yeah, there usually is."

Mia: "Ooh! Lillie-pillies! Let's pick some for our buddies!"

Captain: "Okay!"

The two pick some lillie-pillies.

Captain: "What's your favorite fruit?"

Mia: "Uhh, lychees! What's yours?"

Captain: "I like mangoes."

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mackenzie. Now with Calypso gone they're back to waiting for their buddies to return.

Mackenzie: "Are you going to go back to your fairy garden?"

Bluey: "Uh, no. It's not as much fun without my buddy."

Mackenzie: "Yeah, same...Wanna play barky boats with me?"

Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"

Mackenzie: "We can race our buddies!"

Bluey and Mackenzie ready their barky boats.

Bluey: "Ready? One, two, three, go!"

Mackenzie: "Wooo!"

Bluey: "Go, Mia!"

The shot cuts to Mia and Captain, now lying on the forest floor, resting under the sun.

Mia: "Are you nervous about starting high school?"

Captain: "A little."

Mia: "Me too...at least we'll be there together!"

As the two smile and their tails wag, the shouts of their buddies can be heard in the distance.

Captain & Mia: "Our buddies!"

Bluey: "Noo, Mia won!"

Mackenzie: "No she didn't, Captain won!"

Bluey: "No he didn't!"

Mackenzie: "Yes, he did!"

The two blow raspberries at each other. Soon after they burst into laughter with one another. Mia and Captain run back.

Captain: "We're back!"

Bluey & Mackenzie: "Hooray!"

Mia: "We're so sorry, Bluey! I don't know what happened..."

Captain: "We were looking for barky boats..."

Mia: "And went down this way, and that way and--"

Captain: "And we found some lillie-pillies, and then I...I don't know what happened!"

Bluey: "That's okay! You made it back!"

Bluey hugs Mia, and Mackenzie does a fist-bump with Captain.

Mia: "Come on Bluey, let's finish the fairy letter!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Before Bluey goes to hop on Mia's back, ready to leave for the fairy garden again, she stops and looks over to Mackenzie and Captain. She runs over to hug Mackenzie.

Bluey: "See 'ya, Mackenzie!"

Mackenzie: "See 'ya, Bluey!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Bluey and Mia leave. Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Captain run back to the barky boats pond.

Captain: "Alright, come on! Let's do the biggest dam ever!"

Mackenzie: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia. The fairy garden is complete, and Mia is ready to continue with Bluey's letter to the fairies.

Mia: "Okay, ready Bluey!"

Bluey: "Dear fairies: Dad bought new grass. It had ants! I love my buddy Mia, cause she can do the splits, and she gives me piggybacks."

Mia: "Oh, I love giving you piggybacks!"

Bluey: "Please get the ants out of Dad's grass, and also look after Mia when she goes to big school, even though she isn't scared."

Mia stops writing, and begins tearing up at Bluey's words and the feeling that she is heading off to high school soon.

Bluey: "And make sure she doesn't forget to come and play with me. Kiss kiss kiss, hug hug h-"

Mia hugs Bluey, with Bluey smiling in return.

Bingo: Ow! Awww... I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again.

Bluey: And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her.

Bandit: (grabs her arm) Hang on, not so fast.

Bandit (offscreen): Let's just see what happens next.

Trivia
This episode is a one-time spin-off of the entire series as it focuses primarily on Bluey's sister, Bingo.
Bingo gets her own title card, intro and outro in this episode. She says "This episode of Bingo is called "Bingo"" instead of "This episode of Bluey is called "Bingo"".
Chilli says “sweet as, Bingo”, in a Kiwi accent, a reference to what country the Kiwi animal lives in.
Bingo breaks the fourth wall when she looks at the camera and tells her answer for "I Spy", which in this case, is a rug.
It is revealed that Bingo loves to eat raspberries and blueberries.
The soundtrack that plays throughout this episode is Mozart's Sonata No. 16.
This episode's inspirational poster is based on a movie poster for Home Alone.
This is the 1st instance of a sound effect in the title card.
Bandit's response "Not again!" to the missing New Zealand piece is a possible reference to the countless times NZ has been left off world maps. Including the game board for Risk™ and on a map in an episode of Star Trek.
Long Dog: This version of the dog is teal with a purple nose and is reading a newspaper. It can be seen on the right side of the screen during the scene where Chilli comforts Bingo in the playroom closet.

Script.jpg
The episode opens in a grassy meadow. Bandit is laying on his back on a picnic blanket. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are approaching him. They have all drawn faces on their right hands, with markers and googly eyes. Bingo's hand is also decorated with a flower crown and feather wings. They walk their fingers over the picnic blanket, using their hands as puppets.

Chilli: Once, there were two sisters:

The episode cuts to an extreme close up on their hands, giving us a puppets-eye view. Chilli's puppet has a frown and worried expression. Bluey's is smiling. Bluey's puppet picks up a fork.

Chilli: [voiceover] Big Sister --

Chilli: (as Big Sister) Hi!

Chilli: [voiceover] And Little Sister.

Bluey: (as Little Sister) Hi!

Bingo: [voiceover] And also, a little fairy.

Chilli: [voiceover] Oh, yes! And also, a little fairy.

Little Sister spins in a circle, flailing her fork.

Little Sister: Eeee!

Big Sister: Whoa! Be careful, Little Sister! You'll have someone's eye out with that thing.

Little Sister drops the fork.

Little Sister: And the Big Sister was no fun at all.

Big Sister: Hey! I'm lots of fun!

Little Sister: Nuh-uh!

Chilli: [voiceover] Anyway, it was winter and very cold.

Big Sister: Brrrr! We need to find somewhere warm to sleep, little sister!

Bingo: (as Little Fairy) I know a place that's got the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Sister: Where are they, Little Fairy?

Little Fairy: Beyond the Blue Mountains!

An extreme low-angle shot of Bandit's feet, knees, and stomach, framing them as a mountain range.

Little Sister: Yay! The Blue Mountains!

TITLE CARD - Blue Mountains

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called the Blue Mountains.

Back to the opening shot, showing whole characters.

Chilli: (as Big Sister) No way are we going to the Blue Mountains.

Cut back to the puppets-eye view.

Big Sister: It's too dangerous!

Little Sister: I told you she was no fun. Race you!

Bingo: (giggles)

Big Sister: Hey!

Little Sister and Little Fairy run off together. They stop when they encounter Bandit's tail.

Little Sister: Whoa, look!

Big Sister hides behind a sandwich.

Big Sister: Stay back, Little Sister! We don't know what that is!

Little Sister: (giggles) Don't worry. It's friendly.

Little Sister briefly lifts up the tail and lets it drop.

Big Sister: Brrr! We'd best get going.

Cut to Bandit's foot. Little Sister and Little Fairy leap onto his foot and begin climbing his leg.

Little sister: Hooray!

Cut to Bandit's shin. Little Sister is skipping backwards up the slope.

Big Sister: This is too steep.

Little sister: Oh, big sister, don't be a stick in the mud.

Cut to Bandit's knee. The girls enjoy a panoramic view.

Big Sister: (gasps)

Little Sister: What a view!

Big Sister: How do we get down?

Little Fairy: We slide! Whee!

Little Sister: Whee!

They both slide down Bandit's thigh. Big sister hesitates.

Big Sister: Okay. Here we goooo!

Big Sister also slides down. We cut back to Chilli.

Chilli: (laughs)

Chilli licks her finger and erases Big Sister's frown, then draws a smile on instead. Back in puppet-vision, Big Sister is sliding down Bandit's thigh.

Big Sister: Whee! Yeah! That was fun!

The three of them are bouncing on Bandit's belly.

Little Sister: It's so soft and squishy!

Big Sister: It _is_ soft and squishy, isn't it, little sister? It's like we're bouncing on a massive pikelet.

Bandit: (growls)

As Bandit growls, the screen shakes and rumbling sound effects suggest an earthquake.

Little Sister: What's happening?

Bandit folds his arms, creating a massive wall across his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Little Sister: How are we gonna get past this big wall?

Big Sister: It's too high to climb!

Little Sister: We'll never find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.

Little Fairy: My sweeties, there's a secret spot somewhere here. We just have to find it.

Big Sister: Oh, yes! And if we scratch it, it makes the wall come tumbling down.

Little Sister: Hee, okay!

Big Sister: You try over there.

Little Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs lightly. Big Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs harder. Little Fairy tickles Bandit. He laughs even harder.

Little Sister: This is the spot!

Big Sister and Little Fairy come and tickle the same spot.

Little Fairy: Yeah, that's the spot!

Big Sister: You got it!

Bandit laughs and raises his arms. All three begin running towards his chest.

All: Aaaah!

Big Sister: Run for your lives!

Bandit's arms slam back down behind them.

All: Hooray!

They dance and laugh.

Big Sister: Yeah! Oh, I'm having so much fun, little sister. Maybe I do just need to relax and enjoy myself more. I wonder why I ever stopped in the first place.

Bandit: (offscreen) Well, hello!

Bandit's hand puppet appears. He's stuck a nose and tail on his hand, and drawn pointy ears on his wrist. He's even given his puppet shoes and a monobrow.

Bandit: (as the fox) I am a kindly fox.

Big Sister: Oh, look at this cute little fella.

The Fox: You wouldn't be looking for the warmest, softest beds in the whole world, would you?

Big Sister: We are!

The Fox: Well, you're in luck. I can show you the way.

Big Sister: Oh, great! Did you hear that, kids?

Little Sister: Big sister, I think he's a cheeky fox.

Big Sister: A what?! No, he's a kindly fox. He said so. Ooh, look at his cute little tail.

The camera cuts to the fox doing leg stretches. His right eye falls off, and he puts it back on. When the camera cuts back, Little Sister is frowning.

Little Sister: I'm not so sure.

Big Sister: Oh, come on, little sister. Now who's being boring?

Little Sister: Hey!

Little Fairy: Little sister, we need to find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world, otherwise, we'll freeze.

Little Sister: Oh, all right.

Big Sister: Okay, kindly fox. We'd love you to show us the way.

The Fox: Oh, very good! Right this way.

Bandit hums as they walk across his chest. Big Sister addresses the fox privately as they walk.

Big Sister: I'm usually a real worry wart, but this trek to the Blue Mountains has really shown me how to relax and have fun.

The Fox: Oh, splendid!

Little Sister: I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.

The Fox: That sister of yours is hard work, isn't she?

Big Sister: She sure is.

They arrive at Bandit's open mouth.

Little Sister: It's a cave!

Big Sister: Oh, wow, it stinks!

The Fox: (muffled, as Bandit is trying not to move his mouth) I'm sure it's not that bad.

Big Sister: Oh, Kindly Fox, is there something wrong with your voice?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, no, I just like to talk like this sometimes.

Big Sister: Very strange. Well, we best get going. Are you coming, too, Kindly Fox?

The Fox: (muffled) Uh, I actually have to go and buy some more... hand cream.

Big Sister: Okay. Thanks for your help.

The Fox: (muffled) Yep. In you go.

The Fox leaves.

Little Sister: I'm not sure this is a good idea.

Big Sister: Oh, quiet, Little Sister. Now who's a stick in the mud? Last one into the cave's a rotten egg!

Big sister runs towards the cave; Little Sister and Little Fairy chase her.

Big Sister: Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!

She reaches Bandit's mouth, which slams shut on her. Saliva sprays everywhere.

Big Sister: (muffled) Aaah!

Little Fairy and Litte Sister: (gasp)

Little Fairy: Big Sister!

Big Sister: (muffled) Help, Little Sister!

Chilli: (out of character, laughing) He's licking me!

Big Sister: (muffled) Let me out!

Little Sister: It was a trick! What are you gonna do?!

The Fox: (laughs)

Little Sister: You! You are a cheeky fox! That's it. No one traps my big sister. Hyah!

Little Sister picks up The Fox, and with Little Fairy's help, throws him. He lands with his legs lodged in Bandit's nostrils.

Little Sister: Wait for it! Wait for it!

Bandit: Bleahh!

Bandit, unable to breathe, spits out Big Sister, and sends The Fox flying into the sun.

All: Yeah!

The sisters and fairy land on the picnic blanket. Big Sister is covered in spit. Her eye falls off, and she puts it back on.

Big Sister: Ew. I'm all slimy!

Little Sister: Big sister! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe!

They embrace, wetly.

Little Sister: I promise I'll never say you're boring ever again.

Big Sister: Oh, I was so busy trying to be fun, I forgot the most important thing big sisters are meant to do.

Little Sister: What's that?

Big Sister: Look after their little sisters.

Little Fairy: Look!

Little Fairy points to Bandit's ears.

Little Sister: The softest, warmest beds in the whole world!

Big Sister: Yeah!

Little Fairy: We found them! Hooray!

Big Sister: Oh, it's so soft. And look, there's enough wax in here to make a hundred candles!

Bandit pokes Big Sister with the tip of his ear.

Big Sister: Ohh!

Bluey, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit all laugh.

The puppets are shown sleeping under Bandit's ear.

Chilli: [voiceover] And they all slept happily ever after.

Bluey: "Bob, this is Mixed-up Murphy, he's really funny."

Bingo: "Yea. Really funny."

Chilli: "Oh, Bingo.."

Now outside, a saddened Bingo sits under the tree holding Bob Bilby. Chilli, Bandit and Bluey enter, with Chilli coming to sit beside her.

Chilli: "Are you alright, Bingo?"

Bingo: "This is the most boring time Bob's had in the whole book."

Chilli: "No, that's not true, kiddo!"

Bluey looks at the pictures they've taken with Bob.

Bluey: "Yeah, it is!"

Bingo begins to tear up again.

Bingo: "I'm the worst friend Bob's got. He's never going to want to visit again."

Chilli: "Aww..."

Bandit: "Okay, let's sort this out. What's the best move right now?"

The four contemplate on what to do next.

Bluey: "I know!"

My second day on the planet.

Look at all this. It's amazing!

And look at this little blue thing. Ohh.

And a red thing!

Hi. Agh!

(BOTH GIGGLE) It makes noises. Amazing.

Who are you calling 'It'?

We have names.

Oh, I'm sorry. I was born yesterday.

I don't know what a name is.

It's something you call something.

Like my name is Bluey. And mine's Bingo.

Blue-y.

Bin-go.

BOTH: Yes.

Can I have a name?

You've already got one. It's Bandit.

Ban-dit. I like it.

Oh, look at that.

This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

It's just a stool.

Hello, stool.

My name is Bandit.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) Stools can't talk!

Really? Why? They're not alive.

Alive? Yeah.

Alive?

No, that's not alive.

Oh! Uh, is it?

That's called food. You put it in your mouth.

Why would I put it in my... Ohh.

Oh, I feel like a new dog.

I like food. Thanks for the update.

And stools can't talk.

Kids, what have you done to your dad?

He was born yesterday.

He doesn't know anything.

Are you alive? Yoo-hoo!

Hi, I'm your wife.

My wife?

Yes, and if you want me to stay your wife,

you'll learn about dishwashers.

Dishwasher. Wife.

Wow. There's just so much to learn.

Whoa!

This is outside.

You've got some grass and some wood.

A fence. Argh! Look out!

BOTH: What is it?

There's a giant fireball in the big blue thing.

That's the sun. It's meant to be there.

And the big blue thing is the sky.

Oh. Phew.

This is a swing. Push me!

Swing.

No, the other way.

Oh, OK.

Swing.

BOTH: (GIGGLE) No!

This way.

Oh, swing.

This is... Oh! (BOTH GIGGLE)

So, this is our street.

You've got some cars and, ooh, a bird.

Ooh, rubbish.

Ooh! Don't worry about the sun.

It's meant to be there.

Uh, OK.

Ah, come on, Bandit. Huh?

Keep walking. I have a wife.

OK, Bandit, probably don't say things about the sun

to people at bus stops.

Yeah. Why?

It's hard to explain.

OK, I won't. Food!

(SINGS) Yeah, I got my steak and bacon.

Food! Oh, hey Bandit. Oi!

BOTH: Agh! Dad. No.

That's my pie! Get off it!

Drop! Gimme it.

Here! Food!

Oh, you ate all the sauce!

Sorry, Lucky's Dad. He was born yesterday.

Yeah, I'll say.

(GROANS) I can't hold him!

Run, Lucky's Dad. But I'm going that way.

Food! Just go!

Wah!

Oh. Bye, food. Ugh.

You can't just take people's food. Why?

'Cause it doesn't belong to you.

B-long?

Yeah, like everyone's stuff isn't everyone's, you know?

Everyone?

Look, just don't take people's food.

And don't talk about the sun, OK?

You have to just trust us. Why?

Well, because we've been on this planet longer than you.

That's true. I was only born yesterday.

G'day, Bandit.

I have nothing to say about the sun to you.

(BOTH GIGGLE) Er, great.

Wow. Name?

Oh, that's called a... Wait, Bingo.

It just makes trouble when we tell him what things are called.

Why don't we let him enjoy just looking at things today?

Yeah, we can teach him names later.

Name?

It doesn't matter. Just look.

Alive.

Hello, stool.

It's OK, Dad.

You can stop playing Born Yesterday.

Oh, you sure?

Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, real fun. Thanks.

No worries. I enjoyed it.

I feel like a new dog.

Bingo, can you help me unpack the dishwasher?

Sure.

Oh, good on you, kids.

Uh, kids? BOTH: Yeah?

Has your dad stopped playing Born Yesterday?

Yeah.

OK.

Just checking.

[Theme Song]

The epside begins in the backyard of the Heeler's family house. Bandit is hanging a fabric swing on a branch and Bluey is playing with a slap wrap.

Bingo: Make sure it's nice and high off the ground.

Bandit: Yes, boss.

Bluey snaps the wrap on Bandit's tail.

Bluey: Snap!

Bandit: Ow! Bluey! That's not making this any easier.

Judo peeks over the hedge.

Judo: What are you doing, Bluey's Dad?

Bluey: Hey, Judo.

Bandit: Just putting up a swing.

Bluey: Yeah, it's a fabric swing.

Bingo: Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school.

Judo: I know that. Bluey's my friend.

Bandit finishes putting up the swing.

Bandit: All right, have fun, squids. [He walks off the bench and takes the laundry basket.] I've gotta take the washing in.

Bluey excitingly jumps into the swing, giggling in the process.

Bluey: Let's play butterflies!

Bingo & Judo: Yeah!

[TITLE CARD]

Bingo [voiceover]: This episode of Bluey is called Butterflies.

The scene transitions to Bluey crawling like a caterpillar.

Bluey: Okay, first, the caterpillar crawls along the ground, [She gets in the swing] then it gets in the cocoon. [She then jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly] Then it hatches as a butterfly. But the butterfly catchers have been hiding and catch it.

Bingo: Ooh, can I be the caterpillar first?

Judo: I'm going first.

Bluey: Come on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey & Bingo run to hide behind the shed, while Judo lies down on the ground and begins crawling.

Bingo: Judo is so bossy.

Bluey: Yeah, she is, but she doesn't have anyone else to play with.

Bingo notices a ladybug walking on the wall of the shed.

Bingo: Ooh!

The scene cuts to a more detailed close-up of Bingo.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to blow his nose ♪

Bluey & Bingo stick out their tongues and blow hard making a farting noise. They both then laugh.

Bluey: She's coming out!

Judo jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly.

Bluey: Catch her!

Judo tries to run away, but Bluey & Bingo catch her. Bingo then lies down on the ground.

Bingo: My turn.

Judo: You're too small to be a caterpillar.

Bingo: No, I'm not!

Bluey: Go on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.

Bluey then runs towards the shed. Judo gives Bingo an angry look before catching up with Bluey. After that, Bingo starts crawling. She then gets in the swing, struggling a bit in the process.

Judo: [Sigh] Little kids take so long to do everything!

Bluey: She's only got little legs.

Bingo finally gets inside the swing.

Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love him at all ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

The scene changes to Bluey and Judo standing behind the shed.

Bluey: Hurry up, Bingo.

Judo: Hey, Bluey.

Bluey: Yeah?

Judo: Let's run away from Bingo.

Bluey: What? Why?

Judo: She's taking ages!

Bluey: Well, uh... [She looks towards the swing.]

Judo: Come on!

Bluey: Wait for me!

Bingo finishes the song.

Bingo: Okay! I think I'm almost ready to be a butterfly now!

Bingo jumps out of the swing, again, waving her arms.

Bingo: Ooh! Look at me. I'm a butterfly!

Bingo: I'm flapping around. I hope there's no butterfly catchers nearby!

She takes a look behind the shed, only to find out Bluey & Judo are not there.

Bingo: Oh, where are they?

Bingo goes to looks for them both, still waving her arms. She walks by Bandit who is hanging laundry and still has the slap band on his tail. She then sees Bluey and Judo playing Pat-a-cake.

Bingo: Bluey! You were meant to catch me.

Judo: Aaaaah! Quick, Bluey, run away!

Judo then runs away. Meanwhile, Bluey is put in an uncomfortable situation and has to act fast. She turns around to follow Judo, while a look of regret appears on her face.

Bluey: Quick! We can hide in my house!

Bingo tears up and returns to the swing. Meanwhile, Bluey & Judo emerge from a bush.

Judo: I think we lost her.

Bluey: Uh, I might go and see if Bingo's all right.

Judo: She'll be fine. Now, let's play phones. [Judo types something on a imaginary phone.]

Bluey: Phones?

Judo: Ring, ring. Ring, ring!

Bluey: [Looking at her hands confused]I just think that Bingo might like-

Judo: [Interrupting] Ring, ring!!!

Bluey: Aaah! [Picks up the imaginary phone] Hello?

Judo: Hi. It's me, Judo. I've had such a nice day. Let me tell you all about it.

Bluey: Okay...

Judo: [Walking away] First, I bought some lovely new plants...

Bluey: Oh, is that right?

The scene cuts to Bingo sitting in the swing sad, singing the song. Then the scene cuts back to the front of Judo's house. Bluey is sitting on the lawn. She appears bored.

Judo: So, then I went to the bakery to get some cream buns for Casper, but they ran out of cream buns. Could you believe it?

Bluey: [Looking towards her house] Judo, I think I need to find Bingo.

Judo: So then I asked for chocolate éclairs...

Bluey: Judo-

Judo: ...but they were out of them, too! I mean, come on. I just don't know what the world's coming to.

Bluey: Okay, then. I'm going now. Bye. [Hangs up the imaginary phone.]

[Bluey gets up and quickly runs to her house.]

Bluey: Bingo! Bingo, where are you?

Bluey then runs past Bandit, who was still hanging the laundry. Bluey decides to look for her in the laundry basket, throwing out some of the laundry out.

Bandit: Hey!

Bluey then approaches the swing where Bingo sits.

Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean to run away from you. Well... she didn't make me do it. I did it a bit myself. I'll never do it again, Bingo. I promise. Please can we play together?

Upon not getting an answer from bingo, bluey tears up and sits down on the lawn next to the swing.

Bluey: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪

♪ Ding, jing ♪

♪ No one to love her at all ♪

Bingo: ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bluey: [Turning around to Bingo] ♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪

Bingo: [Sticking her head out of the swing] ♪ Jing, jing ♪

Bingo then offers a hug to Bluey, which she accepts.

Judo: [Off-screen] Ring, ring!

Bluey: Oh, no! It's Judo on the phone! Tell her I'm not here!

Bingo: No! Quick, hide!

Judo walks by Bandit, who was picking up the laundry basket. As she walks by, she makes the "Ring, ring!" sound, which scares Bandit, causing him to drop the basket. Next she walks by the swing.

Judo: Ring, ring! Bluey! Where are you?

The scene changes to Bluey & Bingo hiding inside the swing.

Bingo: Put your phone on silent!

Bluey: Oh, yeah. Good idea. [Puts the phone on silent, vibrating her hand.] Thanks, Bingo.

Judo then suddenly peeks inside the swing, which scares both Bluey and Bingo.

Judo: There you are! You ran away from me.

Bingo: [Sticks her head out of the swing] Well, you ran away from me!

Bluey: [Also sticks her head out of the swing] And you were ignoring me.

Judo: Oh, yeah. I did...

Bluey: [Gets out of the swing] Okay, new rule. From now on, no one runs away from anyone, okay?

Judo: Okay.

Bingo: Okay.

Bluey: Sorry, Judo.

Judo: That's okay. I'm sorry, too, Bingo.

Bingo: That's okay. Just don't do it again.

The three girls then hug each other, giggling.

Bluey: All right, Bingo, you can be the butterfly.

Bingo: Actually, I wanna be the catcher.

Bluey: Me too.

Judo: Me too.

Bluey: Oh, but who will we catch, then?

Bandit: ♪ I'm gonna put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, unh ♪

♪ Put these clean clothes away, I'm gonna --♪

His singing gets interrupted because the three girls jumped on him.

Script.jpg
The episode starts at the Gold Coast, where Chris's house is. The shot cuts inside Nana's house, where Bandit and Stripe have dropped off the kids Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, and Socks. Bluey is trying on her nana's glasses, Socks is playing with Nana's tail, and Muffin and Bingo are chasing after each other, orbiting around her. Bluey gives Nana her glasses back and joins the two.

Bandit: "Okay Mum, at least try and limit the amount of ice blocks to a reasonable number."

Nana: "Okay, got it!"

Stripe: "Right, let's go!"

Bandit: "See 'ya, kids! Be good to Nana!"

The Pups: "Bye!"

Nana closes the door as the two exit. The pups stare at her.

The Pups: "Ice blocks!"

Nana: "Yeah!"

The shot cuts outside the apartment, with the pups enjoying their ice blocks and Muffin holding Socks so she can eat hers.

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, sweetie?"

Bluey: "Why do we get lots of ice blocks at your house, but hardly any when we're at our house?"

Nana: "Oh, well, that's a good question!"

Bingo: "Finished! Can we play charades now?"

Bluey & Muffin: "Yeah!"

Socks: "Woof!"

EPISODE TITLE: Charades

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Charades!"

The shot cuts to Nana's apartment, where the pups and Nana sit on the couch. Nana is sorting through the charade cards.

Muffin: "What's charades?"

Bluey: "It's easy, Muffin! First, you pick a card..."

Bingo: "But don't let anyone see it, okay?"

Muffin: "Okay!"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Bluey: "Then, you look at the picture on it!"

The card shows a picture of a duck.

Bluey: "Okay, got it."

Muffin: "What's on the card?"

Bingo: "No, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I need to see it!"

Muffin gets up and tries to pull the card box out of Nana's hands. Bluey and Bingo panic while Socks barks playfully.

Nana: "Oh- uh, no sweetie! We don't look at it! Bluey's going to act it out!"

Bingo: "And then we guess what it is!"

Muffin: "Ohhh!"

Bluey runs in front of the table.

Bluey: "Okay, ready?"

Bingo, Nana and Muffin: "Ready!"

Bluey proceeds to act out being a duck, walking in circles.

Muffin: "Uhhh, eagle!"

Nana: "Ohhh, it's a...bush turkey!"

Bingo: "Ibis!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bluey: "Nope!"

Nana: "Brolga!"

Bingo: "Chicken!"

Nana: "What about you, Socks?"

Socks whines, unable to guess.

Bingo: "Duck!"

The Pups: + Nana: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Good one, Bingo!"

Bingo: "Ooh, my turn!"

Muffin: "I want a turn!"

Bingo and Muffin fight over the card box. Nana stops Muffin as they try to pull it away from each other.

Nana: "Maybe just watch one more, sweetie!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Nana: "Go on, Bingo, pick a card!"

Bingo picks a ballerina card and squeals as she runs up. The shot shows us what the card is, and she sets it down after memorizing it.

Bingo: "Ooh, this is a good one! You ready?"

The Pups + Nana: "Ready!"

Bingo proceeds to act out being a ballerina.

Nana: "Uhhh...circle!"

Bluey: "Donut!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Nana: "The sun!"

Muffin: "Squirrel!"

Bingo: "Uh-uh!"

Muffin: "Chicken!"

Bingo: "Nope."

Bluey: "A dancer!"

Bingo: "Close!"

Nana: "Ooh, what do you think, Socks?"

Socks whines, again not being able to guess.

Muffin: "CHICKEN!"

Bluey: "I know! Ballerina!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

Nana: "Hooray!"

Muffin: "Good one, Bluey!"

Socks whines, saddened by being unable to play properly.

Nana: "Oh, never mind, Socks!"

Muffin: "It's my turn!"

Nana: "Okay, Muffin, your turn! Are you sure you know how to do it?"

Muffin runs up to the front, and Bingo goes to sit down.

Nana: "Pick a card! Okay now, take a look!"

Muffin looks down at her card. She gets a frog card.

Nana: "Now act it out!"

Muffin: "I don't want a frog card. I want the ballerina card!"

Nana: "Oh. Uhh...well..."

Bluey: "Muffin, you have to do the one on the card!"

Muffin: "BUT I WANT TO DO THE BALLERINA!"

Nana: "O-oh, okay! Bluey, why don't you look through the box for the ballerina card?"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey looks through the card box.

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Bluey: "...Hang on. Won't we know that Muffin is a ballerina?"

Nana: "Oh, y-yeah, but we'll play along for the littlies, okay?"

Bluey: "Oh, okay nana!"

Nana: "Almost there, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Okay, nana!"

Bluey: "I can't find it!"

Muffin: "Keep looking!"

Bluey pulls a car card out.

Bluey: "What about a car?"

Bingo: "Ooh! Would you like to be a car, Muffin? You can do this!"

Bingo rolls on her back, attempting to emulate a car.

Muffin: "That's a squirrel!"

Nana: "Give me those cards, Bluey!"

Bluey: "That's not a car!"

Bingo: "Yeah it is!"

Bluey: "A car's like this!"

Bluey mimics movement of a steering wheel.

Bingo: "That's a steering wheel!"

Nana: "It must be in here somewhere..."

Muffin: "I don't want to be a car! I want to be a--"

Nana: "Ballerina!"

The Pups:' "Hooray!"

Nana: "There you go, Muffin!"

She gives Muffin the ballerina card.

Muffin: "Thanks, nana!"

Nana: "Okay, off 'ya go!"

Muffin stares at the card, an angry expression still plastered on her face.

Muffin: "I NEED A TUTU!"

The Pups groan in annoyance, and Nana thinking of a quick solution.

Nana: "O-oh, um...Bluey! Go and check Nana's dress-up box for a tutu!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Bluey and Bingo run off to Nana's room.

Nana: "Quickly! She's going to blow her top!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo in Nana's dress-up room. They look around in the box on the ground.

Bluey: "Ooh. Confetti."

She rummages through the stuff.

Bluey: "Pirate...princess...-"

Bingo: "Tutu!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently, and Nana is petting Socks. Bluey and Bingo run in.

Bluey: "Here's the tutu, Muffin!"

Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"

Nana: "Oh, good one, girls!"

Bluey: "Put your legs through, Muffin!"

Muffin: "I'm trying!"

Bingo: "That's your arm!"

Bluey and Bingo help Muffin into her tutu.

Nana: "Push...Yeah, that's it!"

After some struggling they manage to get Muffin's tutu on.

Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: "Hooray!"

Nana: "Okay...off 'ya go!"

Muffin stands still for a brief moment, ready to act out a ballerina...

Muffin: "I need ballerina music!"

The Pups and Nana groan in annoyance.

Bluey & Bingo: "Muffin!"

Nana: "How about I sing you some?"

She starts singing, only for Muffin to get angered.

Muffin: "NO! IT NEEDS TO BE PROPER BALLERINA MUSIC!"

Bluey: "You don't need music, Muffin! You just need--"

Muffin: "I WANT MUSIC!"

Bluey: "Okay!"

Nana: "O-oh, um...Oooh, I know! Bluey, Bingo, come with me!"

The shot cuts to Nana's bedroom, where she grabs a music box on the table.

Nana: "Did you know that I was given this music box by my nana?"

Bluey: "You mean you had a nana?"

Nana: "I did! A long time ago."

Bingo: "Hang on. We all know Muffin is going to be a ballerina."

Nana: "Well yes, I guess we do."

Bingo: "But that's not the proper rules!"

Nana: "You're right, Bingo. But that's what Muffin wants."

Bingo: "I don't understand!"

Nana: "Well, you know what? At Nana's house, I guess there's only one rule."

Bluey & Bingo: "What's that?"

Nana: "Everyone gets what they want!"

Bluey & Bingo: "Oh yeah!"

The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently and Socks staring nervously at her. Bluey, Bingo and Nana enter!

Bluey: "We got the music!"

Nana: "Okay. You ready, Muffin?"

Muffin: "Ready!"

Nana: "You ready, Socks?"

Socks: "Woof woof!"

Nana: "You ready, girls?"

Bluey & Bingo: "Ready, Nana!"

Nana: "Okay, let's go!"

Bluey: "Nana?"

Nana: "Yes, Bluey?"

Bluey: "Was your nana a nice nana?"

Nana looks down at the music box, a sincere smile on her face.

Nana: "She was about the nicest nana you would ever wanna meet, Bluey."

Nana opens the music box, and begins winding it to create sound. With the music going and the room falling silent, Muffin begins dancing.

Bingo: "Hey Nana? When she's finished, should we pretend that we didn't know what she was?"

Nana: "Good idea, Bingo!"

Bluey: "Cause we have to take care of the littlies!"

Nana: "That's right!"

Muffin: "Shush!"

Nana smiles and continues playing the music box. Soon, the music comes to a close.

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Muffin!"

They throw confetti and Muffin smiles.

Muffin: "Can you guess what I was?"

Bluey, Bingo and Nana:' "Uhh...any idea? What was Muffin...?"

Socks: "Ballerina!"

The Pups and Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Socks!"

The episode pans out, showing the outside sunset as the pups laugh and Socks barking.

Lila: My name is Lila and this is my story (View outside of kindy) This is me on my first day at kindy. I was really shy. Mum says, that's OK, but that meant sometimes I wasn't really good at making friends. I just didn't know how to do it. But then one day that all changed. (The Heeler house) And it started with pet feet.

Bluey: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bingo: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.

Bluey: Oh, you're extra stinky this morning.

This startles Bandit awake.

Bingo: Look at those big muscles! [while she is patting his muscles]

Bandit: [Lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast] Sorry Bingo. You slipped.

Chilli: [Waves goodbye to Bluey & Bingo] I'll see you in the morning, kids.

Bluey: [Runs to Chilli] I don't want you to go.

Chilli: [Rubs Bluey's Cheek] I know sweetie, but Mummy has to go to a baby shower tonight, okay?

[Bandit lets of of Bingo and grabs her fast again. Chilli gets in the car.]

Bandit: Oh! Again!

Bluey: Will I already be asleep when you get back?

Chilli: Yes, but I'll still come in and give you a kiss good night.

Bluey: But I won't feel it!

Chilli: Yes, you will.

Bingo: Who'll put us to bed?

Chilli: Your dad! It's a Daddy putdown.

Bingo: Hooray!

[Bluey lets out a sad yelp.]

Bandit: Don't worry, Bluey. I'm all over it.

He lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast yet again, this time Bingo almost hitting the ground.

Bandit: Whoa! That was a close one. No more of that game.

[Title card]

Bluey (voiceover): This episode of Bluey is called Daddy Putdown.

[The scene changes to the front of the house. Chilli honks the horn and drives off.]

Bandit & Bingo: Bye!

Bandit: Okay, kids, what should we do?

[Bluey takes out Bandit's phone.]

Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.

[Bandit takes the phone away.]

Bandit: We're not doing that.

Bluey: But I miss her!

Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?

Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to the dining room of the Heeler's house.]

Bandit: Right! I'm your Magnificent Leader, and you have to follow me. You kids got that?

Bluey & Bingo: Yes, Leader! [Both giggle]

Bandit: Now off to a better tomorrow!

[Bandit turns around and starts walking in a march-like fashion, with Bluey & Bingo following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪

♪ Something, something, united, we are strong ♪

[Both girls turn around and run into the living room and sit down on the couch. Bandit then walks in.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow-- ♪ Oh, hello, there! I- What?!

[Bluey & Bingo giggle]

Bandit: You were supposed to be following me!

[Bluey & Bingo laugh]

Bandit: Get back in line! [Both girls get off the couch and stand behind Bandit] Sitting around will not be tolerated!

[He starts walking in the march-like fashion with both girls following him.]

Bandit: ♪ Follow, follow, follow the Leader ♪ Hmm. I'd best check on these followers to make sure they are indeed following me.

[He turns around, and Bluey & Bingo quickly get behind him.]

Bandit: Hey! What?

[He turns around multiple times, with both of the girls hiding behind him.]

Bandit: Hmph! Where are they?! Grrr! They've gone again!

[Bandit then looks for them in the house, but both girls still hide behind his back when he turns around. He then walks out of the house into the backyard.]

Bandit: There's that giggling again!

Bluey & Bingo: [whispering] One, two, three...

[They proceed to scare Bandit.]

Bandit: You little traitors!

[Bandit then starts chasing the girls. They run around in circles, before being caught by Bandit and falling down on the ground. Bluey & Bingo then giggle.]

Bingo: [Sits on Bandit's belly] Again!

Bandit: Oh, no, mate. The Magnificent Leader needs a break.

Bluey: I miss Mum! [She sits down on the lawn.]

Bandit: Maybe that game wasn't swingy enough. [Points to the swing.]

Bingo: [Gasps and gets off Bandit and runs up to the swing.] I know! Come Here and Go Away!

Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!

[The scene cuts to Bandit pushing the swing with both girls sitting on it.]

Bandit: Okay, kids, come here.

[Bluey & Bingo swing to Bandit.]

Bandit: Now, the thing is-- [They swing away.] What?

[Both girls giggle.]

Bandit: Come here! [They swing back to Bandit.]

Bandit: Okay. So, as I was saying-- [They swing away again] What?!

[Both Girls giggle again]

Bandit: I said, come here! [They swing back to Bandit once again.]

Bandit: What? Aah! [They swing away yet again.]

Bluey: Now play Go Away!

Bandit: Okay. Go away! [He pushes the swing away.]

[Bluey & Bingo swing back to Bandit.]

Bluey: Hi!

Bandit: Huh? I said, go away! [He pushes the swing away as both girls start laughing.]

[They swing back to Bandit again.]

Bluey: We're back!

This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.

Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.

Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.

Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.

Bingo: Oops.

Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.

Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?

Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?

Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?

Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.

Bandit: SCAB!

Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.

Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?

Bandit: Ee!

Bluey: Dad ate it.

Bandit swallows guiltily.

Bingo: (betrayed) What?!

Crossing the Street/First Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Crossing.png
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.

Bingo: I was saving that chippy.

Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.

Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.

Bingo: I was still very hungry.

Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?

Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.

Bluey: Ah! I know.

Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.

Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!

Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode.

Bingo and Bluey giggle.

TITLE CARD - Dance Mode

Bluey: [voiceover] This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.

Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.

Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!

Bingo: Me too!

Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.

Bluey and Bingo: Okay.

The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.

Chilli: Green dog. Come on.

The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.

Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?

Bingo: Um, yes, okay.

Bluey: I'll do it.

Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.

Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)

As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.

Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! [to the drivers] She's not with us!

Chilli: Bandit!

Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it. Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.

Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!

Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.

Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!

Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.

Chilli: Phew.

Bluey: That was so funny.

Chilli is sweating a lot.

Bandit: You still got it, babe.

Chilli: You'll get yours.

Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.

Bluey: Okay.

Post Office/ Second Dance Mode
Dance-Mode-Post-Office.png
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.

Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?

Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.

Bluey: Oh, yeah.

Bandit: Aw, what a shame.

Postie: Next, please.

Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.

Postie: How can I help?

Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.

Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.

Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.

Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.

Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.

Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?

Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --

Chilli: Pretty please.

Chilli makes her Please Face.

Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.

Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.

Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.

Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.

Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.

Bandit: Oh no!

Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.

Chilli: Dance mode!

Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.

Postie: Uh, are you okay?

Bandit does some kicks.

Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this.

Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card

Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?

Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...

Bandit does The Running Man.

Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.

Bandit does a Cossack dance.

Bandit: I would if I could, mate.

Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.

Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!

Busker busking in the plaza
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.

Chilli: That was glorious.

Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?

Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.

Music starts to play.

Bluey: What's that noise?

Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;

Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!

Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.

Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.

Bandit: Nothing to see up there.

Bluey: Ooh, look!

Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing Dance Mode on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.

Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)

The Heelers approach.

Busker: Shake your tails!

Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!

Bingo: Wow!

Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?

Bingo: Ooh, yeah!

Bluey: Do it, Bingo.

Bingo: Dance mo--

Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.

Bandit: Oh, hang on.

Chilli: Yeah, hang on.

Bingo: Hey.

Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.

Bingo: Aw, what?

Bluey: No fair!

Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.

Dance-Mode-Bribe.png
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.

Chilli: Bandit, no!

Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!

Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.

Bluey makes her Please Face.

Bluey: Please, Bingo?

Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.

Bandit: Pretty please?

Bingo: Uh. Okay.

Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.

Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!

Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.

Bandit: Phew!

Chilli: This is not good parenting.

Yes/No Button Store
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.

Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.

Bluey: And if you push this one...

Dance-Mode-Shop.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey laughs.

Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?

Bingo: Uh, okay.

Bluey: Hooray!

The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.

Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.

Heeler's Car
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?

Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?

Bingo shakes her head.

Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?

Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."

Dance-Mode-Car-Talk.png
Yes/No Button: NO

Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!

Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.

Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?

Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: I thought so.

Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.

Bingo presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?

Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."

Yes/No Button: YES

Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?

Bandit: This is confusing.

Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?

Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.

Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.

Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES

Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.

Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.

Chilli: Me too.

Bandit: Yeah, me too.

Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.

Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?

Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.

Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES

Back at the plaza
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.

Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!

The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.

Bluey: This is gonna be fun!

Bandit: Oh, boy.

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.

Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!

Bingo squeals and moves into position.

Bluey-Bandit-Chilli-Dancemode.png
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.

Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.

Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.

Bingo: Ready?

Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.

Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for my kid.

Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.

Bingo: Dance Moooode!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.

Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!

As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.

Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES

Busker: Whoo! Yeah!

Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.

Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!

Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.

Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!

[End credits]

Busker's song continues through the end credits.
