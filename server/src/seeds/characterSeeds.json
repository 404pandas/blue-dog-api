She's the wife of Bandit, the mother of Bluey and Bingo, the aunt of Muffin and Socks, the daughter-in-law of Bob and Nana, and the sister-in-law of Trixie, Rad, and Stripe. Her father is Mort, and her older sister is Brandy. Chilli works part-time in airport security. As a child, Chilli spent a lot of time playing in the scrub near her father’s home. Her family would vacation at a caravan park where Bandit would recall meeting her as children. Chilli doesn't remember this but admits it could be true. She recalls their first meeting being a party in London. Chilli would later remember Bandit having a finger up his nose when they first met. The two began dating, and Bandit eventually proposed to Chilli while they backpacked in Italy. They later married, and guests included Frisky, who would later become Bluey’s godmother, and Bandit's brother Rad. The wedding venue included a pool, which Rad probably fell into. Sometime after the wedding, Chilli became pregnant and gave birth to Bluey. Bingo, their youngest daughter, was born a couple of years later. Chilli currently lives with Bandit and their daughters in the suburbs."
