  "characterName": "Bingo Heeler",
  "description1": "Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.",
  "decription2": "Bingo Heeler is one of the main characters of Bluey. Serving the role as a deuteragonist, she is the younger daughter of Bandit and Chilli, the younger sister of Bluey, and niece of Stripe, Trixie, Rad, and Brandy.",
  "catchphrase": "This is confusing.",
  "appearance": "Bingo is a Red Heeler with light cream, orange and dark orange fur. She has cream feet, hands, tail tip, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, orange legs, arms, tail stem, torso and inner ears, and a dark orange tail spot, back spot, left and right head and outer ears. She also has a brown nose.",
  "personality": "Bingo is a character that loves to play. She's rather on the passive side and often depends on her older sister when playing as mentioned on the official page and seen on many episodes such as Hairdressers. She likes to observe tiny bugs as seen on episodes such as The Weekend and Bingo. She doesn't like to play rough as seen on episode Yoga Ball. She's smart and has broad knowledge of everyday things as seen on episodes Fruitbat and The Dump. She can get heartbroken when people or Bluey make fun of her or when she thinks they are making fun of her, as seen in Favourite Thing.",

    "It is currently shown that Bingo can only count to fourteen as seen in Hide and Seek.",
    "Bingo and Socks, Bluey and Muffin's little sisters, have so far not had their middle names revealed.",
    "Bingo has her own dedicated episode of the same name in season 2.",
    "It is often shown that Lila is Bingo's best friend, which started through Lilas' first day at Kindergarten in Daddy Dropoff.",
    "An older Bingo and Lila can also be seen at the end of the episode.",
    "Bingo speaks with a faint, but noticeable nasally voice.",
    "In some episodes, whenever she interacts with an insect, her close-ups are in 3D animation instead of 2D.",
    "She is the second character (after Chloe) who had their birthday and aged up in the series.",
    "In Sleepytime, Bingo was the second Bluey character that was pictured crying, instead of just tearing up.",
    "She is also pictured crying when she first loss in Pass the Parcel.",
    "Her favourite colour is blue as mentioned in Easter.",
    "In The Pool, Helicopter and Duck Cake, it has been mentioned that Bingo is taking ballet, gymnastics and mini-hockey respectively.",
    "While not as bad as her sister, Bingo often gets confused for a boy, since Bingo is usually a name for a male dog, and her voice can sometimes sound like a young boy. It helps, however, that Bingo looks a lot like her mother.",
    "In addition, there is a popular children's rhyme about another dog named Bingo, who is said to be male. In fact, nearly every other dog named Bingo, real or fictional is male.",
    "Bingo sometimes finds some games too rough, as mentioned in the episode Yoga Ball.",
    "However, this seems to have improved through later episodes in the show, such as Pirates.",
    "In season two, Bingo’s car seat has changed. In season one, she was in a lap-sash seat and the creators received feedback from fans saying she wasn’t big enough for that, so now she’s in a four-point harness seat.",
    "Bingo is very similiar in appearance to her aunt Brandy, as mentioned in Onesies."
