AD
Unaired 2016 pilot
This pilot is unaired, not released on any social media and only staff of Bluey and Ludo Studio can view the pilot as it remains secretive compared to the 2017 pilot. The plot involves Bandit pushing Bluey on a swing whilst playing on his phone and at one point accidentally pushes Bluey hard which made her go 360 around the swing set and “presumably fell off the swing”. Due to its “disturbing” moments, the 2016 Bluey pilot was never released at all.

Season 1
Hospital
The title card is fixed due to a misspelling.

Keepy Uppy
For some reason, the scene with Bluey blowing up the balloon was cut in the CBeebies airing, due to concerns about children with asthma wanting to do the act.

BBQ
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, the word from the original Australian release "capsicum" is replaced with "pepper" possibly due to "capsicum" not being a familiar word in the United States.

Fruitbat
The scene where Bluey plays "penguins" was cut in the CBeebies UK version, probably because it may be dangerous. The scene was cut but they still mention it.

Horsey Ride
In CBeebies UK version, the scene where Muffin shows Chilli her flip flops (sandals) as “thongs” is removed as the United Kingdom considered the word “thongs” as an adult underwear.

Markets
In the Disney-distributed versions of the episode, Buttermilk taking a poop then Bluey and Indy running away was cut due to toilet humor.

The Pool
The scene where Bandit tells Bluey to put his flip-flops (thongs) has been cut just like Horsey Ride on CBeebies UK & the scene where Bluey talks underwater was cut in the CBeebies UK version, probably because talking underwater may be dangerous and can cause drowning.

Taxi
In the US version, the episode ends with Bandit saying "Oh, biscuits" before the screen fades out. In the AU version, the ending continues with Bingo as Millicent pretending to barf on Bandit due to a grossout. Despite this, in some countries, such as Poland, and on DisneyNOW and on Disney+, the AU version is present.

Chickenrat
In the latest and Disney-distributed version & CBeebies UK Version of this episode, the sauerkraut makes Bandit burp. The original AU version portray him sneezing. Despite this, the original version still airs on Disney Junior but the subtitles for it incorrectly use that of the latest version.

Teasing
This episode has been removed from ABC IVIEW due to a complaint by a viewer stating that the episode included a term with racial connotations and a problematic history for Indigenous Australians ("Ooga Booga"). The episode would be pulled from Disney & CBeebies UK broadcasts but came back on CBeebies, and would not be available on Disney+ as a result. The new AU and US versions (as well as the DVD releases) has the insult removed with the word "Shooby-Doowah", but the US captions still read the insult, "Ooga Booga."

This episode never has been on Disney+ in some countries, like Spain.

The Sleepover
The part where Muffin bites the inflatable guitar causing it pop and the parts where Bingo says “babe” were cut in the CBeebies airing.

Daddy Putdown
In the Disney-distributed versions of this episode, the part when Bingo asks Bandit how babies get in their mother’s belly was removed since it was, in Disney’s eyes, a bit too cheeky and inappropriate.

Season 2
Hairdressers

The scene with Bandit getting splattered in flour got cut from the CBeebies airing, just like The Sleepover, probably to prevent children wanting to do that in real life.

Sticky Gecko
The line, "dammit, really stuck!", was removed in international English airings of the episode due to "dammit" being considered a profane word in the US, and the line is only heard in the original Australian version. Some people have debated on what is actually said as the line is rather hard to hear, but the closed captions on ABC iView say "dammit, really stuck!". It should be noted that "damn" is not considered a swear word in Australia.

Dad Baby
The episode was skipped from Disney Channel and Disney+ in the United States, presumably because of the episode's depiction of “acting out child birth (even though playing)” could cause controversy from American parents. This has sparked some debate among watchers, some claiming that Disney was not justified in removing an entire episode.

Trains
In this episode, Bluey's line “It’s a piece of poo!” was changed to “That’s a slug!” for the Disney-distributed version. Bandit's line "I licked poo!" was removed probably due to references to coprolalia. The mouth movements were reanimated to accommodate him spitting instead.

Escape
The word "axe" got replaced with "pick" to make the lines more family friendly. However, on DisneyNOW and on Disney+, the edit is not present.

Flat Pack
Similar to Teasing, this episode was pulled from air due to "Ooga Booga", when Bluey and Bingo pretend to be cavedogs. The re-edited version had them say "Ooh Ooh" instead. But unlike Teasing, the re-edited version was always the one on DisneyNOW and Disney+.

Mr. Monkeyjocks
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode:

Bandit saying “He’s gone crazy” is changed to “He’s gone bananas”.
Chilli referring to Mr. Monkeyjocks as “Lover boy” is changed to “sweetheart” due to the phrase “Lover Boy” possibly being misinterpreted by viewers.
Season 3
Perfect
In the original version of this episode, while talking with Fido, Bandit says, "look, I'm keen to get it done, but Chilli, she wants to keep her options open. But I don't know. Do we want any more of these things running around?" (In reference to getting a vasectomy/neutered so they don't have more children.)

In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, this line is changed to "yeah, I know. I probably should get it done. But I love my dog teeth! What if one day I just want to bite someone?" His mouth movements are reanimated to fit this new dialogue.

Born Yesterday
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, the scene where Bandit is hit in the groin with the tree swing is cut.

Mini Bluey
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, the scene where Bluey tells Bingo she looks crazy and Bingo telling Bluey to follow her is cut.

Housework
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, the scene where Bandit injures his groin and Chilli spins and falls while trying to imitate Bingo's "bee-yoop" walk is cut.

Pass the Parcel
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, the pile of poo from the pony Buttermilk is removed.

Explorers
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, instead of saying he is from France, the French Backpacker says that he and the Argentinean Backpacker are backpackers.

Driving
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, every mention of the cat toy Agatha peeing on the curtains is replaced with mentions of her scratching them up due to toilet humor.

Family Meeting
Family Meeting was originally omitted from the Disney Channel and Disney+'s lineup, but later added to Disney+ in USA, still missing in some countries.

Faceytalk
In the Disney-distributed version of this episode, when Muffin runs by Trixie, who is on the toilet, Muffin's face is zoomed in on so Trixie is no longer visible due to adult humor.
