    "characterName": "Bluey Christine Heele",
    "description1": "Bluey is a seven-year-old Blue Heeler pup who loves to play. Her parents and teacher give her lots of time to practice, which means she’s become very good at inventing games, helping everyone choose their roles and deciding on the rules. Her favourite games are ones that involve lots of other kids and grown-ups (especially her dad) and she likes to pretend she’s a grown-up doing grownup things herself",

She has a rectangular shaped body, and has light blue paws, outer muzzle, eyebrows and chest, blue legs, arms, torso, head and tail stem, dark blue torso spots, tail tip, outer ears and head spots, and tan inner ears and muzzle. She also has a black nose",
    "personality": "Bluey, in general, is an energetic character who loves to play, as described on the official page.

She really likes to play with her friends too.",

    "firstAppearance": "The Magic Xylophone",
    "trivia": "Being the main protagonist, Bluey has never made an absence on any episode, except Turtleboy,She has only been absent in four shorts, namely Pea Pod Sausages, Green Bottles, Mower and Honk.,Viewer gender confusion: Bluey has frequently been mistaken as a male by many viewers, mainly due to her looking like her father, having some traits of a young boy and her being blue, a stereotypical boy color. In fact, when the show first aired, nearly all initial viewers assumed Bluey and Bingo were male, as their gender had not been said in the first few episodes, though a few episodes later, it was stated that Bluey and Bingo were female dogs. Even after this, many people who have only seen small things from the show tend to think Bluey is a boy, it has even got to the point where plush toys of Bluey nearly always get put in the boys toys aisle of stores, and in some cases, the plush is even straight up listed as a boy dog plush in online listings of it. The confusion was further fueled in Kids, when a cashier says to Bluey, 'What a nice young boy you have there!' (refering to Bandit), as many people believed that the cashier was talking to Bandit. This is later referenced in a few episodes, in Double Babysitter when Uncle Rad said, 'cause he's blue,' after which Bluey corrects him, saying that she is a girl.,Bluey's favourite animal is fruit bat, as seen in Fruit Bat.,Bluey's favourite colour of capsicum (bell pepper) is yellow, as mentioned in the episode BBQ.,Bluey's favourite breakfast is fruit salad, as mentioned in the episode Fruit Bat.,Bluey's older version can be seen at the end of episode Camping.,Bluey's family is the first to have a known surname.,Bluey once played as a cameo, as seen on episode Army.,Bluey and Bingo have unlockable Emojis on the DisneyNOW app and website that can be used on the user's profile. These emojis use the art style of Disney Emoji Blitz, a match-3 puzzle game for mobile phones.,She may be unable to read as seen in Takeaway and Bus, although in some episodes as well as in the short Crazy Christmas Lights, she can be seen presumably reading a book. However, she might just be looking at pictures.,She is also intrigued by the fact that her buddy Mia can write, which could mean that she is unable to either.,In Library, she can be seen reading aloud, which could mean that Bluey is starting to be able to read. Though again, she could just be trying to retell the story through the pictures.,Throughout Bin Night, she is shown to have a white belt on an unspecified martial art.,Later in the episode, she can be seen advanced to the yellow belt.,Bluey plays the recorder, as shown in Queens and Bin Night.,Baby Race features Bluey when she was still a baby.,In Baby Race, Chilli confirms that Bluey is still two years older than Bingo, although she might just be approximating,It is possible while Bingo's fifth birthday happened in Handstand, Bluey’s seventh birthday is shown in Pass the Parcel,The long distance between her birthdays is somewhat noted by Bandit in Chest, being confused as to why Bluey is still six (she tells him she’s almost seven),In Burger Shop, it is mentioned that she is in preschool, more specifically a preparatory school as stated in Calypso's bio.,In Jingle Bells short, this marks the first short where Bluey speaks.,Bluey is the first charcter to have their middle name revealed,In Family Meeting it is revealed her middle name is 'Christine',In the ABC Kids Listen app's Story Time promo, she briefly cameos as a drawing on a smartphone.,Even though she has the physical appearance of a Blue Heeler, she is technically a Red/Blue crossbreed.,It is likely that she is named after a real dog in Australia named Bluey, who lived to be nearly thirty years old and was the oldest dog to ever live. [see references],To protect their privacy and for 'safety reasons', the identity of Bluey's voice actor is kept a secret from the public unlike many other children's TV shows which reveal actual names of children actors and actresses. And to this day, their identity is still a mystery. The same also goes for the other voice actors for many of the other children, including Bluey's sister, Bingo.,In Onesies, Bluey reveals that she does not like the fact that she looks similar to Bandit.,According to [Family Tree - Part 3) picture] by user Aussie Girl Maggie, (which mentions Chili’s side of the Heeler family) apparently Bluey is stated to be nineteen before the end of Camping.",

    "description1": "Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.",
    "description2": "Bingo Heeler is one of the main characters of Bluey. Serving the role as a deuteragonist, she is the younger daughter of Bandit and Chilli, the younger sister of Bluey, and niece of Stripe, Trixie, Rad, and Brandy.",
    "catchphrase": "This is confusing.",
    "appearance": "Bingo is a Red Heeler with light cream, orange and dark orange fur. She has cream feet, hands, tail tip, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, orange legs, arms, tail stem, torso and inner ears, and a dark orange tail spot, back spot, left and right head and outer ears. She also has a brown nose.",
    "personality": "Bingo is a character that loves to play. She's rather on the passive side and often depends on her older sister when playing as mentioned on the official page and seen on many episodes such as Hairdressers. She likes to observe tiny bugs as seen on episodes such as The Weekend and Bingo. She doesn't like to play rough as seen on episode Yoga Ball. She's smart and has broad knowledge of everyday things as seen on episodes Fruitbat and The Dump. She can get heartbroken when people or Bluey make fun of her or when she thinks they are making fun of her, as seen in Favourite Thing.",

    "trivia": "It is currently shown that Bingo can only count to fourteen as seen in Hide and Seek., Bingo and Socks, Bluey and Muffin's little sisters, have so far not had their middle names revealed., Bingo has her own dedicated episode of the same name in season 2., It is often shown that Lila is Bingo's best friend, which started through Lilas' first day at Kindergarten in Daddy Dropoff., An older Bingo and Lila can also be seen at the end of the episode., Bingo speaks with a faint, but noticeable nasally voice., In some episodes, whenever she interacts with an insect, her close-ups are in 3D animation instead of 2D., She is the second character (after Chloe) who had their birthday and aged up in the series., In Sleepytime, Bingo was the second Bluey character that was pictured crying, instead of just tearing up., She is also pictured crying when she first loss in Pass the Parcel., Her favourite colour is blue as mentioned in Easter., In The Pool, Helicopter and Duck Cake, it has been mentioned that Bingo is taking ballet, gymnastics and mini-hockey respectively., While not as bad as her sister, Bingo often gets confused for a boy, since Bingo is usually a name for a male dog, and her voice can sometimes sound like a young boy. It helps, however, that Bingo looks a lot like her mother., In addition, there is a popular children's rhyme about another dog named Bingo, who is said to be male. In fact, nearly every other dog named Bingo, real or fictional is male., Bingo sometimes finds some games too rough, as mentioned in the episode Yoga Ball., However, this seems to have improved through later episodes in the show, such as Pirates., In season two, Bingo’s car seat has changed. In season one, she was in a lap-sash seat and the creators received feedback from fans saying she wasn’t big enough for that, so now she’s in a four-point harness seat., Bingo is very similiar in appearance to her aunt Brandy, as mentioned in Onesies.",
