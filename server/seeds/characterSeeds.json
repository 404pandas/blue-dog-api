    "firstAppearance": "The Magic Xylophone",
    "trivia": "Being the main protagonist, Bluey has never made an absence on any episode, except Turtleboy,She has only been absent in four shorts, namely Pea Pod Sausages, Green Bottles, Mower and Honk.,Viewer gender confusion: Bluey has frequently been mistaken as a male by many viewers, mainly due to her looking like her father, having some traits of a young boy and her being blue, a stereotypical boy color. In fact, when the show first aired, nearly all initial viewers assumed Bluey and Bingo were male, as their gender had not been said in the first few episodes, though a few episodes later, it was stated that Bluey and Bingo were female dogs. Even after this, many people who have only seen small things from the show tend to think Bluey is a boy, it has even got to the point where plush toys of Bluey nearly always get put in the boys toys aisle of stores, and in some cases, the plush is even straight up listed as a boy dog plush in online listings of it. The confusion was further fueled in Kids, when a cashier says to Bluey, 'What a nice young boy you have there!' (refering to Bandit), as many people believed that the cashier was talking to Bandit. This is later referenced in a few episodes, in Double Babysitter when Uncle Rad said, 'cause he's blue,' after which Bluey corrects him, saying that she is a girl.,Bluey's favourite animal is fruit bat, as seen in Fruit Bat.,Bluey's favourite colour of capsicum (bell pepper) is yellow, as mentioned in the episode BBQ.,Bluey's favourite breakfast is fruit salad, as mentioned in the episode Fruit Bat.,Bluey's older version can be seen at the end of episode Camping.,Bluey's family is the first to have a known surname.,Bluey once played as a cameo, as seen on episode Army.,Bluey and Bingo have unlockable Emojis on the DisneyNOW app and website that can be used on the user's profile. These emojis use the art style of Disney Emoji Blitz, a match-3 puzzle game for mobile phones.,She may be unable to read as seen in Takeaway and Bus, although in some episodes as well as in the short Crazy Christmas Lights, she can be seen presumably reading a book. However, she might just be looking at pictures.,She is also intrigued by the fact that her buddy Mia can write, which could mean that she is unable to either.,In Library, she can be seen reading aloud, which could mean that Bluey is starting to be able to read. Though again, she could just be trying to retell the story through the pictures.,Throughout Bin Night, she is shown to have a white belt on an unspecified martial art.,Later in the episode, she can be seen advanced to the yellow belt.,Bluey plays the recorder, as shown in Queens and Bin Night.,Baby Race features Bluey when she was still a baby.,In Baby Race, Chilli confirms that Bluey is still two years older than Bingo, although she might just be approximating,It is possible while Bingo's fifth birthday happened in Handstand, Bluey’s seventh birthday is shown in Pass the Parcel,The long distance between her birthdays is somewhat noted by Bandit in Chest, being confused as to why Bluey is still six (she tells him she’s almost seven),In Burger Shop, it is mentioned that she is in preschool, more specifically a preparatory school as stated in Calypso's bio.,In Jingle Bells short, this marks the first short where Bluey speaks.,Bluey is the first charcter to have their middle name revealed,In Family Meeting it is revealed her middle name is 'Christine',In the ABC Kids Listen app's Story Time promo, she briefly cameos as a drawing on a smartphone.,Even though she has the physical appearance of a Blue Heeler, she is technically a Red/Blue crossbreed.,It is likely that she is named after a real dog in Australia named Bluey, who lived to be nearly thirty years old and was the oldest dog to ever live. [see references],To protect their privacy and for 'safety reasons', the identity of Bluey's voice actor is kept a secret from the public unlike many other children's TV shows which reveal actual names of children actors and actresses. And to this day, their identity is still a mystery. The same also goes for the other voice actors for many of the other children, including Bluey's sister, Bingo.,In Onesies, Bluey reveals that she does not like the fact that she looks similar to Bandit.,According to [Family Tree - Part 3) picture] by user Aussie Girl Maggie, (which mentions Chili’s side of the Heeler family) apparently Bluey is stated to be nineteen before the end of Camping.",

She's smart and has broad knowledge of everyday things as seen on episodes Fruitbat and The Dump.

It helps, however, that Bingo looks a lot like her mother., In addition, there is a popular children's rhyme about another dog named Bingo, who is said to be male. In fact, nearly every other dog named Bingo, real or fictional is male., Bingo sometimes finds some games too rough, as mentioned in the episode Yoga Ball., However, this seems to have improved through later episodes in the show, such as Pirates., In season two, Bingo’s car seat has changed. In season one, she was in a lap-sash seat and the creators received feedback from fans saying she wasn’t big enough for that, so now she’s in a four-point harness seat., Bingo is very similiar in appearance to her aunt Brandy, as mentioned in Onesies.",

    "trivia": "He is voiced by Dave McCormack, the frontman of Australian '90s Indie rock band Custard. This is also the debut of McCormack in animated television, The next character to be voiced by a member of a band is Postie. He used to play touch football, as mentioned in Fruitbat. He wants to do it again, but has been too busy with parenting and his job. He likes to watch cricket, as seen in Horsey Ride & The Weekend. He likes to play squash, as seen in Squash. He burps after eating sauerkraut in the original dub of Chickenrat. However, in the Disney dub, he sneezes after eating sauerkraut. This could possibly mean he is allergic to sauerkraut. Another possibility is they simply changed it to be more family friendly for America. He loves bananas, but hates rockmelon (cantaloupe), as mentioned in Trampoline. He makes several “dad-jokes” to Bluey and Bingo as shown in a couple of episodes of Season 1, most notably in The Creek and The Pool. As of Season 2, he doesn’t do “dad-jokes” as much, but he still has his cheekiness in some episodes in Season 2. He is the only male member of the main cast. It is yet to be shown of where Bandit works. A younger version of him can be seen in the flashback of the episode Baby Race, wherein he lacks the hairs. Bandit farted at least in five episodes (as humour) in Daddy Robot, Fairies, Teasing,Family Meeting, and Smoochy Kiss, though this gag has decreased as of Season 2. Family Meeting reveals that baked beans, nut roast, and pie can all give him gas. Bandit can ride a skateboard as seen in Bob Bilby Bandit once peed in a pool as seen and said by Chilli in Swim School. He was claimed Dad of the Year in 2019. Bandit is often seen reading the newspaper in most episodes. Bandit’s child-friendly expletives are mostly food related phrases; Bandit says, “Oh, Biscuits!” in several episodes. He says, “Cheese and Crackers!” in Daddy Robot and Taxi. He also says, “Beans on Toast!” and “Goodness Gravy!” in Taxi. He says, “Bread and Jam!” in Tickle Crabs. He exclaims, “Oh, Duck Cake!” in Duck Cake. He says, “Crumbed Steak” in Road Trip. Before the title cards when Bluey and Bingo decide what game to play, Bandit says “Oh no, not [NAME OF GAME]” after Bluey and/or Bingo says the name of the game. He is left-handed, as revealed in The Claw. He will get cranky when he is hungry, as revealed in Omelette. A ten-year-old version of Bandit can be seen in Fairytale. Bandit is revealed to be the middle child in the same episode. In Fairytale, a cassette for the song Bad Medicine by Bon Jovi can be seen. This song was released in 1988, meaning that the events of Fairytale would have taken place during 1988 or 1989. Because Bandit was 10 years old in Fairytale, he would have been born some time between 1977 and 1979. Assuming Season 3 takes place in 2022, this would place him somewhere between 43 and 45 years old in Season 3. Bandit is revealed to have a doctorate in archaeology in Archaeology. In Polish dub, his name is Bandżi (pronounced bungee). Seesaw reveals that he weighs about as much as Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, and Coco put together. In Movies, he's revealed to dislike musical movies, as when the character in the movie he and his daughters were watching started singing, he exclaimed, Ugh! Songs!. Family Meeting reveals that he charges his tablet on the bedside table and sometimes drops it. It’s revealed in Pavlova (Episode) that Bandit, and possibly Chilli, in the English Dub, can both speak French. Because Bluey and Bingo don't speak French, Bandit takes advantage of that to speak nonsense French to them, as if teasing them.",

Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback. Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet. In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering proof of life - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the Grandad stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family. Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it. This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence. In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as grandad when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob. His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode Grannies, and in the Grannies book. A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name. He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit. Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.",

In Library, Stripe reveals her nickname: Chilli Dog. In the Weekend Pilot, she is at one point drawn without her brown fur patch on her face, despite this, her pilot design did have the brown patch. She was called by the zoo visitor name Lady Gaberdine in Zoo. Chilli is voiced by Australian actress, model, artist, journalist, and performer Melanie Zanetti. She is named after the hot-tasting spicy vegetable of the same name; the Chilli Pepper. Her maiden name may be Cattle, although this depends on whether or not Brandy is married. Brandy's last name was confirmed by Nick Rees on Twitter (@N1ckBee5) who made a poster for the Onesies episode and credited her last name as Cattle”.[9] She seems to enjoy eating sardines, as revealed in Smoochy Kiss. Her job as airport security might be a reference to sniffer dogs, and she might even be one. Chilli is known to frequently hum the show's theme song. Doing so across multiple episodes.",

    "trivia": "Mackenzie's appearance was inspired by Dog from the New Zealand comic Footrot Flats.[1] He is one of very few kids that have a known voice actor along with Chloe, Judo, and Snickers. He is from New Zealand. He can be seen in the pilot episode in the theme song, but with a different design, as his left leg and foot are the same as his right leg and foot, instead of having a white left leg and black left foot. Mackenzie with Bluey appear to show some friendly rivalry. Mackenzie and Bluey do have disagreements when playing games, as prominent in Shops. In Barky Boats, both Mackenzie and Bluey blew raspberries at each other. He calls Bandit Bluey's Dad (The Creek). He is 6 years old as revealed in Barky Boats. Like Bluey and Bingo, many fans at first thought that he was the opposite gender because of the name Mackenzie usually being a girl name. This has even led to some international dubs of the show incorrectly portraying Mackenzie as a girl. In the first season of the Latin American dub, he is incorrectly portrayed as female, this is fixed in the following of said dub. MacKenzie's family name was revealed in Curry Quest. In Space, it's revealed that Mackenzie used to have an abandonment issue stemming from a time when he was little where he found himself separated from his mother. At the end of the episode, he is able to find closure and move on. In Polish dub, his name is Kołnierzyk which means Collar. In Curry Quest, when Bandit is saying goodbye to Mackenzie and his parents, he refers to them as the Border Collies or perhaps a variation such as Border-Collies. This would imply that that is their family surname.",

When she had longer hair, she could be seen with green, blue, yellow, and pink hair rings. The Early Baby episode reveals that Indy has a sister that either had a premature baby or was a preemie baby herself. (At the moment, this hasn't been elaborated on.) it can be assumed, though based on what Bluey says that it was her sister that had the premature or early baby since she says, Indy wanted to play Early Baby like her sister in real life. Another character that mentioned her sibling and still didn't appear in the series, is Winnie. Her name is a diminutive of Indianapolis.",
