Bingo
Bingo
Bingo is Bluey's younger sister. She’s 4 years old, and a red heeler like her mum. Bingo also likes to play but she is a bit quieter than Bluey, so is more likely to be the customer than the shop owner. Sometimes though, when Bluey asks her to be the doctor, rather than the patient, she really enjoys it. When she’s not playing you can find her in the yard talking to tiny bugs or off lost in her own beautiful world.

Trivia
It is currently shown that Bingo can only count to fourteen as seen in Hide and Seek.
Bingo and Socks, Bluey and Muffin's little sisters, have so far not had their middle names revealed.
Bingo has her own dedicated episode of the same name in season 2.
It is often shown that Lila is Bingo's best friend, which started through Lilas' first day at Kindergarten in Daddy Dropoff.
An older Bingo and Lila can also be seen at the end of the episode.
Bingo speaks with a faint, but noticeable nasally voice.
In some episodes, whenever she interacts with an insect, her close-ups are in 3D animation instead of 2D.
She is the second character (after Chloe) who had their birthday and aged up in the series.
In Sleepytime, Bingo was the second Bluey character that was pictured crying, instead of just tearing up.
She is also pictured crying when she first loss in Pass the Parcel.
Her favourite colour is blue as mentioned in Easter.
In The Pool, Helicopter and Duck Cake, it has been mentioned that Bingo is taking ballet, gymnastics and mini-hockey respectively.
While not as bad as her sister, Bingo often gets confused for a boy, since Bingo is usually a name for a male dog, and her voice can sometimes sound like a young boy. It helps, however, that Bingo looks a lot like her mother.
In addition, there is a popular children's rhyme about another dog named Bingo, who is said to be male. In fact, nearly every other dog named Bingo, real or fictional is male.
Bingo sometimes finds some games too rough, as mentioned in the episode Yoga Ball.
However, this seems to have improved through later episodes in the show, such as Pirates.
In season two, Bingo’s car seat has changed. In season one, she was in a lap-sash seat and the creators received feedback from fans saying she wasn’t big enough for that, so now she’s in a four-point harness seat.
Bingo is very similiar in appearance to her aunt Brandy, as mentioned in Onesies.

He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!"

Appearance
Bandit is a Blue Heeler with blue, light blue, tan and black fur. He has light blue feet, hands, outer belly, outer muzzle and eyebrows, blue legs, arms, tail tip and torso, tan belly, muzzle and inner ears, and black tail stem, head and outer ears. He also has a black nose and beard whiskers on his muzzle.

Personality
Bandit is a character that loves to play with his daughters. He will take his role in a game seriously even though he's often seen unwilling and reluctant whenever his daughters mention a game to play. While playing with his daughters, he often teaches them life lessons along the way.

Biography
Bandit is one of the members of the Heeler family. He's the husband of Chilli, the father of Bluey and Bingo, younger brother of Rad, older brother of Stripe, brother-in-law of Trixie, son of Bob and Nana, the uncle of Muffin and Socks and the son-in-law of Mort. He works as an archaeologist.

When he was younger, Bandit was a bully to his younger brother Stripe as a child. One day, Bandit was jinxed by Rad, so he was not allowed to speak until someone said his name.

At the time he was at England, he met Chilli or possibly someone who looked similar to her, she now has no memory of this occurring though she and her family has spent vacations there. There is “some dispute” as to the exact circumstances, but it apparently took place “at a party in London.”[1] Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met,[2] though Bandit argues later on that they had met in a holiday park when he was 10.[3] Eventually, the two began dating, and later on went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted; the pair were later married.[4] Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey.[5] Bandit would later claim to have “wrecked [his] back changing [Bluey’s] nappies,” though he probably only said this in jest. Bingo, their younger daughter, was born a couple of years later.[6]

However, in the Disney dub, he sneezes after eating sauerkraut.
This could possibly mean he is allergic to sauerkraut.
Another possibility is they simply changed it to be more "family friendly" for America.
He loves bananas, but hates rockmelon (cantaloupe), as mentioned in Trampoline.
He makes several “dad-jokes” to Bluey and Bingo as shown in a couple of episodes of Season 1, most notably in The Creek and The Pool.
As of Season 2, he doesn’t do “dad-jokes” as much, but he still has his cheekiness in some episodes in Season 2.
He is the only male member of the main cast.
It is yet to be shown of where Bandit works.
A younger version of him can be seen in the flashback of the episode Baby Race, wherein he lacks the hairs.
Bandit farted at least in five episodes (as humour) in Daddy Robot, Fairies, Teasing,Family Meeting, and Smoochy Kiss, though this gag has decreased as of Season 2.
"Family Meeting" reveals that baked beans, nut roast, and pie can all give him gas.
Bandit can ride a skateboard as seen in Bob Bilby
Bandit once peed in a pool as seen and said by Chilli in Swim School.
He was claimed Dad of the Year in 2019.
Bandit is often seen reading the newspaper in most episodes.
Bandit’s child-friendly expletives are mostly food related phrases;
Bandit says, “Oh, Biscuits!” in several episodes.
He says, “Cheese and Crackers!” in Daddy Robot and Taxi.
He also says, “Beans on Toast!” and “Goodness Gravy!” in Taxi.
He says, “Bread and Jam!” in Tickle Crabs.
He exclaims, “Oh, Duck Cake!” in Duck Cake.
He says, “Crumbed Steak” in Road Trip.
Before the title cards when Bluey and Bingo decide what game to play, Bandit says “Oh no, not [NAME OF GAME]” after Bluey and/or Bingo says the name of the game.
He is left-handed, as revealed in The Claw.
He will get cranky when he is hungry, as revealed in Omelette.
A ten-year-old version of Bandit can be seen in Fairytale.
Bandit is revealed to be the middle child in the same episode.
In Fairytale, a cassette for the song "Bad Medicine" by Bon Jovi can be seen. This song was released in 1988, meaning that the events of Fairytale would have taken place during 1988 or 1989. Because Bandit was 10 years old in Fairytale, he would have been born some time between 1977 and 1979.
Assuming Season 3 takes place in 2022, this would place him somewhere between 43 and 45 years old in Season 3.
Bandit is revealed to have a doctorate in archaeology in Archaeology.
In Polish dub, his name is "Bandżi" (pronounced "bungee").
"Seesaw" reveals that he weighs about as much as Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, and Coco put together.
In "Movies", he's revealed to dislike musical movies, as when the character in the movie he and his daughters were watching started singing, he exclaimed, "Ugh! Songs!".
"Family Meeting" reveals that he charges his tablet on the bedside table and sometimes drops it.
It’s revealed in "Pavlova (Episode)" that Bandit, and possibly Chilli, in the English Dub, can both speak French. Because Bluey and Bingo don't speak French, Bandit takes advantage of that to speak nonsense French to them, as if teasing them.

Bluey.tv Description
"Dad is an archaeologist (he loves to dig up bones). As the devoted, yet tired father, he does his best to use whatever energy is left after interrupted sleep, work and household chores, to invent and play games with his two girls. He still tries to continue his own life amidst the chaos of childrearing but often struggles to juggle these two competing tasks!"

Appearance
Bandit is a Blue Heeler with blue, light blue, tan and black fur. He has light blue feet, hands, outer belly, outer muzzle and eyebrows, blue legs, arms, tail tip and torso, tan belly, muzzle and inner ears, and black tail stem, head and outer ears. He also has a black nose and beard whiskers on his muzzle.

Personality
Bandit is a character that loves to play with his daughters. He will take his role in a game seriously even though he's often seen unwilling and reluctant whenever his daughters mention a game to play. While playing with his daughters, he often teaches them life lessons along the way.

Biography
Bandit is one of the members of the Heeler family. He's the husband of Chilli, the father of Bluey and Bingo, younger brother of Rad, older brother of Stripe, brother-in-law of Trixie, son of Bob and Nana, the uncle of Muffin and Socks and the son-in-law of Mort. He works as an archaeologist.

When he was younger, Bandit was a bully to his younger brother Stripe as a child. One day, Bandit was jinxed by Rad, so he was not allowed to speak until someone said his name.

At the time he was at England, he met Chilli or possibly someone who looked similar to her, she now has no memory of this occurring though she and her family has spent vacations there. There is “some dispute” as to the exact circumstances, but it apparently took place “at a party in London.”[1] Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met,[2] though Bandit argues later on that they had met in a holiday park when he was 10.[3] Eventually, the two began dating, and later on went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted; the pair were later married.[4] Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey.[5] Bandit would later claim to have “wrecked [his] back changing [Bluey’s] nappies,” though he probably only said this in jest. Bingo, their younger daughter, was born a couple of years later.[6]

Script.jpg
The classic distant view of the Heeler home is displayed, then cuts to the kitchen, where Chilli is cooking, Bluey is sitting and Bandit walking with a chess board.

Bandit: "Alright, here we go, Bluey." He puts down and opens the chess board on the kitchen countertop. "I'm gonna teach you how to play Chess."

Bluey: "What's Chest?"

Bandit: "No, not Chest, Chess." Putting out the chess pieces

Bluey: "Yeah, Chest."

Bandit: "Ok, fine." Flips over the chess board "I'm gonna teach ya how to play Chess."

Bluey: "Oh! It's like Checkers!"

Bandit: "Yeah, but a lot harder than Checkers."

Chilli: "And so probably a bit old for Bluey, right?"

Bandit: "Oh, how old are you?"

Bluey: "Don't you know how old is your own child is?"

Bandit: "I think I do, but just tell me."

Bluey: "I'm six!"

Bandit: "Are you still six? Wow."

Bluey: "I'm almost seven."

Bandit: "Well, I reckon that's old enough."

Chilli: Chopping carrots "Can I ask why you want to teach Bluey chess?"

Bandit: "To start people playing Chess."

Bingo comes in onto the wooden stepping stair stool prototype

Bingo: "Can I play?"

Bluey: "She's five."

Bandit: "Well, you might not be old enough for Chess, Bingo. But you can watch us play."

Bingo, sad: "Aww."

Bluey: "It's ok, Bingo. You can help me!"

Chilli: "Aw, Bluey."

Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey! Where's the dice?"

Bandit's facial expression turns into a "bruh"

TITLE CARD: Chest

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called, Chest."

TITLE CARD END

Bandit: "Ook, I'll show you the pieces."

Bingo: "Who are the little ball guys?" Holding up one of the white pawns on her and Bluey's side

Bandit: "They’re called "pawns"."

Bingo: "Prawns?"

Bandit: "No, not “prawns”." He puts the pawn down to it's spot from Bingo "Pawns!"

Bluey: "Hello, little prawn!"

Bandit: "Ok, so the pawns can move one square forward. Well, sometimes two squares, but only on the first turn, and can take diagonally, see?"

Bluey and Bingo just blankly stare into Bandit.

Bandit: "Eh, don't worry about that. Now, this goes-"

'Bluey places down a Charlevol figurine

Bandit: "Hang on, who's this?" Points to the figurine

Bingo: "This is Charevol."

Bluey: Places down a Bonny Bom Bom figurine "And this is Bonny Bom Bom!"

Bandit: "Ok, Charlevol and Bonny Bom Bom aren't invited." Putting both of the figurines at the side of the board

Bluey and Bingo: "Aww.."

Bluey: Gasping "A horsey!" Grabs the Knight piece

Bingo: "I've got one too!" Grabs the other Knight piece

Both of them squeal

Bandit: "Ok, he's the Knight."

Bingo: "No, he's a horsey!"

Bandit: "Yeah, he's called the Knight."

Bluey: "No, the Knight sits on the horsey!"

Bandit: "Well, yeah, that's true.”

Bingo: "Everyone knows that."

Chilli: "I thought you said smart people played Chess." Mixing something

Bandit: "Well, whatever you call him-"

Bingo: "Mine's called Gallahop!"

Bluey: "Mine's called... Daughter of Gallahop!"

Bandit: "He moves by jumping!"

Bluey: "Oh yes, horseys love jumping."

Bingo: "Oooh." Grabs the Rook piece "Who is Castlehead?"

Bandit: "That's the Rook."

Bingo: "I'm gonna call him Castlehead."

Bandit: "Fine, Castlehead moves straight like this." Demonstrating to the girls

Bingo: "Castles can't move! This game is confusing."

Bandit: "Yeah, it is Bingo. Maybe you want to do some colouring."

Bluey: "No, she's on my team!" Proceeding to hug Bingo to show that Bingo's on her team.

Bandit: "Agh, right, let's just start." Moves the pawn piece from A7 to A6 "You go, Bluey."

Bingo: "Aww, I want my own Chest team!"

Bandit: "But there is only two teams, Bingo, so maybe you just watch."

Bingo: "Aw."

Bluey: "Dont worry, Bingo." Proceeding to separate the white team in half "There's two horseys, see, two Castleheads, and two.. Pom Pom Elves?"

Bandit: "Bishops."

Bluey: "And the prawns."

Bandit, in an annoyed tone: "Pawnnnss."

Bluey: "So this can be your team, and this one's mine!"

Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey."

Chilli: "Nice one, Bluey." Putting something together which looks like something red

Bandit: "Uh, look, that’s not a-"

Chilli: "Let it go, Deep Blue."

Bluey: "Hang on." Grabs the Queen piece "There is only one crown lady."

Bingo: "And one Wedding Cake head!"

Bandit: "Ah, now that's the King, and that's the Queen."

Bingo and Bluey: Squeals "King and Queen!"

Bingo: "Can I have the Queen, Bluey?"

Bluey: "Uh.. sure!" Hands over the Queen piece for the King piece

Bingo: "THAANNNKS!"

Bandit: "Agh, you can't- eh, that's just fine." Swaps the King and Queen pieces on his side.

Bingo: "Are you sure you’re happy with the King?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I'm ok."

Bandit: "Don't worry, Bluey, the king is the most important piece on the board.

Chilli: unknown sound "Is that right?"

Bandit: "Yes."

Chilli: "And how many squares can he move?" Approaching to Bandit's side.

Bandit: "Well, just one."

Chilli: "Just one square? That was a big square, wasn't it?"

Bandit's face is completely just turns into a "bruh" again.

Chilli: "Oh, I rest my royal feeties. They’re a little tired!"

Bluey and Bingo laugh

Chilli: "Meanwhile," Bumping Bandit out of the way "The queen moves as far as she wants! In any direction. Which is handy, because she has to do all the work!" Moving the Queen piece that looks diagonally, horizontally and vertically

Bandit: "Are you finished?"

Chilli: "Yes."

Bandit: "Anyway, hey, where's Bingo?"

Bingo, having placed the queen on Bandit's bottom, moving to what it's on it's way to a nice lil' picnic

'Bingo: "Ooh, it's a lovely day for a picnic!"

Bandit: "Hey!" Grabbing the Queen piece onto their side while Bingo runs back to her side. Then having to clear up the chess board to it's original state before shenanigans happened.

Bluey: "I thought the queen could go anywhere!"

Bandit: "Bluey, have your turn!"

Bluey: "What do I do?"

Bandit: "Just move a prawn. Pawn!"

Bluey, moving a pawn on C2 to D3”

Bandit: "No, no. Forward only."

Bluey, then moving the pawn on D3 to C4

Bandit: "My turn."

Bingo: "Hey!"

Bandit: "Oh, yeup. Your turn."

Bingo gets on the kitchen countertop

Bingo: "I'm moving Gallahop!" Grabbing a Knight piece and a pawn piece, and moving the Knight from G1 to F6 and the pawn to G2 to F7, already occupying the pawn already from F7.

Bandit: "Ah, no, you can't go that far,mate, and you can't move 2 pieces at once."

Bingo: "But Boulderkiss wants to visit Ms. Shinyhead. They’re friends!"

Bandit: "Well, no, they’re actually enemies."

Bluey: "No, they’re friends!"

Bingo: "They’re little prawns so they can go to kindy together!"

Bandit: "Ok, they’re friends. Ok, watch, this is how you take a piece." He moves the pawn that's on E7 to F6, removing the Knight on F6.. "See?"

Bingo: Gasps "Gallahop!"

Bluey: "It's ok, he just starts back from here."

Bingo: "Oh, phew."

Bandit: "Nah, he's dead."

Bingo: "Gallahop is dead?!"

Chilli: "Of course he's not dead."

Bandit: "Oh,uh, yeah, he's not dead, he's just out of the game."

Bingo: "Awww."

Bandit: "I did say Chess might be a bit older for you."

Bluey: "You’re going to pay, young man. My turn. Right. Where can I move?"

Bandit: "Here or here."

Bluey: "Bang there." Moving the horse from B1 to A3

Bandit: "Ok, now, you see, it's important to keep your pieces protected. I can just take him, like this." Moving the bishop on F8 to A3, and removing the second Knight on the chess board

Bingo: Gasp "Daughter of Gallahop!"

Bluey: "Errgh!" Moving the pawn on C4 to C5

Bandit: "Yeah, I can just take him." Moving the Bishop from A3 to B2

Bluey: "What about here?" Moving the pawn from A2 to A3

Bandit: "Yeah, I'll take him again." Moving the Bishop on B2 to C1

Bluey: "Aah!"

Bingo: "Stop it!"

Bandit: "I'm just showing you the rules!"

Chilli: "Get the queen out, Bluey!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, time for another picnic!" Moving the Queen from E1 to E7, eliminating the pawn.

Bandit: "But... I have him protected." Moves the King from D8 to E7, eliminating the queen.

Bingo: Gasp "My queen!"

Bluey: "Oh, no!"

Chilli: "Really, Bandit!"

Bandit: "Ooh, it was the King who did the honours."

Bluey: "Mum! How do you beat Dad?"

Chilli: Taking off the apron and walking to Bandits side on the chess board. "It's easy."

Bandit: "Here we go."

Chilli: "I can beat him in 4 moves." Giving a bowl to Bingo, and taking the queen piece

Bingo: "Ooh."

Chilli: "I move this guy here." Moving the bishop on F1 to A6, eliminating a pawn.

Bandit: "Heh, great start." Moving the pawn on B7 to A6, removing the bishop. "Doink."

Chilli: "Then, I move him, and ask, “Why do you want to teach the kids this game?”" Moving the Rook from A1 to C1, eliminating the Bishop.

Bandit: Moves the pawn on D7 to D5.

Chilli: "And he answers, “Because smart people play chess.”"

Bingo takes all the chess pieces that were removed from the game

Chilli: "“And I want my kids to be smart.” Next move, I ask: “Why do you want the kids to be smart?”"

Bandit: "Heh, that's a bad move."

Chilli: "This is what I'll say. “Right now, you kids are little prawns."” Moving the pawn piece on F7 to F8, and then replacing the pawn with the Queen piece "“ But one day you'll be queens”."

Bandit removes the queen piece by moving the king piece from E7 to F8.

Chilli: "“And I won't always be there to protect you, so you have to look after yourselves.”"

Bluey jumps down the stepping stair thing to go play with Bingo, playing with the chess pieces.

Chilli: "Moving the piece from F2 to F4 "“But I'm going to do whatever I can now to help you.”"

Bandit: "Checkmate."

Chilli: "”Cause he's a good king.”"

Bandit: "And you’re a good queen."

Chilli: "But a lousy chess player."

Bandit: "And you turned out fine."

Chilli: "Work on the heads later, for now, just hearts." Putting her arm around Bandit

Bluey: Grabs the rook piece to the bowl thing "Here, Bingo!"

Bingo: "Ooh, welcome! First things first, you’re not dead, ok? You’re at a pool party! Yay!" Putting the Rook down into the bowl

It shows the end credits, with the King and Queen piece fading on the credits

Bluey.tv Description
"Bluey & Bingo’s Grandad."

Appearance
Bob is a Blue Heeler with white, grey, black, dark grey and brown fur. He has white feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, grey legs, leg spots, arms, torso, tail tip and head spots, dark grey leg splotches, leg spots, tail stem and right head, black outer ears, and brown leg spots, head spots, left head and inner ears. He also has a black nose, beard whiskers on his muzzle and part of his left ear missing.

In his younger years (during the 80s), his grey fur used to be blue and his dark grey and brown (on his head) fur used be black, similar to his son Bandit. His left ear also used to be whole as well.

Biography
Bob has no known real friends yet, but he is the husband of Chris (Nana), the dad of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the father-in-law of Chilli and Trixie, and the grandpa of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks.

S3E2 - Bedroom (mentioned)
S3E26 - Fairytale (flashback)
Trivia
He has a piece of his left ear missing.
Bob is voiced (as a retiree) by writer, actor, director, producer, teacher, essayist and painter Ian McFadyen.
Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback.
Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet.
In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering "proof of life" - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the "Grandad" stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family.
Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it.
This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence.
In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as "grandad" when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob.
His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode "Grannies", and in the Grannies book.
A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale
Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name.
He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit.
Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.

"After having the kids, Chilli’s recently gone back to her job working at Airport Security and juggles this with raising her two little pups. Mum often has a wry comment about the kids' antics or a kind word for an overwrought child, but she’s equally at home throwing herself into a game and always able to see the funny side."

Original
"After having the kids, Chilli’s recently gone back to her job working at Airport Security and juggles this with raising her two little pups, which means sometimes she falls a bit short of what her other mother friends are able to pull off."

Appearance
Chilli is a Red Heeler with cream, light orange and brown fur. She has cream feet, hands, tail spots, back spots, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, light orange legs, arms, tail, torso and head, brown outer ears and right head and light brown inner ears. She also has a dark brown nose.

Personality
Chilli is a character that cares about her family. She's a comforting character as seen on Yoga Ball and Sleepytime. She likes to play along with her daughter and husband whenever they're setting up games.

Biography
Chilli is a member of the Heeler family. She's the wife of Bandit, the mother of Bluey and Bingo, the aunt of Muffin and Socks, the daughter-in-law of Bob and Nana, and the sister-in-law of Trixie, Rad, and Stripe. Her father is Mort, and her older sister is Brandy.

Chilli works part-time in airport security.

As a child, Chilli spent a lot of time playing in "the scrub" near her father’s home[1]. Her family would vacation at a caravan park where Bandit would recall meeting as children; Chilli does not remember this, but admits it could be the case[2]. She recalls their first meeting being a party in London[3]. Chilli would later recall that Bandit had a finger up his nose when they first met[4].

The two began dating, and eventually went on a backpacking trip to Italy. While there, Bandit proposed to Chilli, and she accepted. The pair were later married[5]. Among the guests at the wedding were Frisky, who would later become Bluey’s godmother, and Bandit's brother Rad. The venue included a pool, which Rad "probably" fell into[6]. Some time afterwards, Chilli became pregnant, later giving birth to Bluey[7]. Bingo, their youngest daughter, would be born a couple of years later[8].

Chilli currently lives with Bandit and her daughters in the suburbs.

This indicates that Chilli is especially annoyed or irritated.

She seems to enjoy eating sardines, as revealed in Smoochy Kiss.
Her job as airport security might be a reference to sniffer dogs, and she might even be one.
Chilli is known to frequently hum the show's theme song. Doing so across multiple episodes.

Trivia
Mackenzie's appearance was inspired by "Dog" from the New Zealand comic Footrot Flats.[1]
He is one of very few kids that have a known voice actor along with Chloe, Judo, and Snickers.
He is from New Zealand.
He can be seen in the pilot episode in the theme song, but with a different design, as his left leg and foot are the same as his right leg and foot, instead of having a white left leg and black left foot.
Mackenzie with Bluey appear to show some friendly rivalry.
Mackenzie and Bluey do have disagreements when playing games, as prominent in Shops.
In Barky Boats, both Mackenzie and Bluey blew raspberries at each other.
He calls Bandit "Bluey's Dad" (The Creek).
He is 6 years old as revealed in Barky Boats.
Like Bluey and Bingo, many fans at first thought that he was the opposite gender because of the name "Mackenzie" usually being a girl name. This has even led to some international dubs of the show incorrectly portraying Mackenzie as a girl.
In the first season of the Latin American dub, he is incorrectly portrayed as female, this is fixed in the following of said dub.
MacKenzie's family name was revealed in Curry Quest.
In Space, it's revealed that Mackenzie used to have an abandonment issue stemming from a time when he was little where he found himself separated from his mother. At the end of the episode, he is able to find closure and move on.
In Polish dub, his name is "Kołnierzyk" which means "Collar".
In "Curry Quest", when Bandit is saying goodbye to Mackenzie and his parents, he refers to them as the "Border Collies" or perhaps a variation such as "Border-Collies". This would imply that that is their family surname.

Trivia
She is not allowed to eat wheat/gluten, sugar, salt, dairy, or food with added ingredients (like prepackaged tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and mustard), whether it be due to her allergies, her religion, her tradition or her family's basic diet.
She is seen with longer hair in some episodes, but the studio shortened her hair to make it easier to animate.
When she had longer hair, she could be seen with green, blue, yellow, and pink hair rings.
The Early Baby episode reveals that Indy has a sister that either had a premature baby or was a preemie baby herself. (At the moment, this hasn't been elaborated on.) it can be assumed, though based on what Bluey says that it was her sister that had the premature or "early" baby since she says, "Indy wanted to play "Early Baby" like her sister in real life."
Another character that mentioned her sibling and still didn't appear in the series, is Winnie.
Her name is a diminutive of Indianapolis.

Appearances

The Show (drawing cameo)
Trivia
Jean-Luc and his parents speak French.
He is French-Canadian in reference to how his breed – the Labrador Retriever – is named after the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. As the name suggests, the province is comprised of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland region of Labrador, which is located in the northeast of Canada and borders the predominantly French-speaking province of Québec. The province also lends its name to another breed of dog: the Newfoundland or "Newfie."
Jean-Luc is similar in appearance to Lucky, but isn’t slimmer towards his waist like Lucky and has different coloured fur.
His future self speaks English as seen at the end of Camping.
A drawing of him and Bluey can be seen in Bingo and The Show.
In the French dub, Jean Luc is renamed Johnny, and he speaks English.
This is the reverse of how it is in the original English version.
He only appears in one episode.
His name is pronounced "John-Luke."

"Bluey & Bingo’s Grandad."

Appearance
Bob is a Blue Heeler with white, grey, black, dark grey and brown fur. He has white feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, grey legs, leg spots, arms, torso, tail tip and head spots, dark grey leg splotches, leg spots, tail stem and right head, black outer ears, and brown leg spots, head spots, left head and inner ears. He also has a black nose, beard whiskers on his muzzle and part of his left ear missing.

In his younger years (during the 80s), his grey fur used to be blue and his dark grey and brown (on his head) fur used be black, similar to his son Bandit. His left ear also used to be whole as well.

Biography
Bob has no known real friends yet, but he is the husband of Chris (Nana), the dad of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the father-in-law of Chilli and Trixie, and the grandpa of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks.

S2E21 - Escape (pictured)
SN/AEN/A - Humpty Dumpty (mentioned)
S3E2 - Bedroom (mentioned)
S3E26 - Fairytale (flashback)
Trivia
He has a piece of his left ear missing.
Bob is voiced (as a retiree) by writer, actor, director, producer, teacher, essayist and painter Ian McFadyen.
Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback.
Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet.
In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering "proof of life" - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the "Grandad" stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family.
Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it.
This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence.
In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as "grandad" when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob.
His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode "Grannies", and in the Grannies book.
A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale
Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name.
He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit.
Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.

Bosco

Bosco
VIEW SOURCE
Bosco is a character mentioned in Bluey. So far, he has never made an appearance; only mentioned.

Frisky was his wife or girlfriend, later he broke up with her before the events of "Double Babysitter". It's never explained why they broke up, though given that Frisky, when acting as a princess for the Heeler sisters, said that Rad (who was playing the prince) would probably go looking for other princesses, this could imply that either Bosco cheated on Frisky, or Bosco dumped Frisky so that he could date another dog.

Appearance
Brandy is a Red Heeler with light orange, dark orange, light cream fur, and a brown nose. She has light cream hands, right foot, left outer ear, left leg, eyebrows, muzzle, forehead, tail spots, belly, a strip in her shoulders and tail end, light orange body, right leg, left foot, start of the tail and inner ears, and dark orange right outer ear, both sides of the head, back spot and tail spot.

Biography
Brandy is Chilli's older sister. She distanced herself due to the grief of her sister being able to grow a family while she herself had fertility issues. They hadn't spoken for years, but Chilli eventually found the courage to call her, which lead to them reuniting in Onesies.

Trivia
It is revealed Bluey didn't even know she had an aunt on her mum's side of the family.[citation needed]
A younger version of Brandy can be seen pictured in Obstacle Course and Promises.
The younger version of Brandy has a slightly different fur pattern, complete with light orange, brown and cream fur, cream feet, hands, eyebrows, back spots, right side of the body and head, a strip in her shoulders, right arm and tail end, light orange back, knees, start of the tail, inner ears and forehead, and brown left side of the head and outer ears.
Prior to Onesies, Brandy and her sister hadn't met face-to-face in four years.
Throughout the episode Onesies, it is heavily implied that Brandy has fertility problems, meaning that she may not be able to have children of her own, which may have caused her and Chilli's argument prior to Bluey's Big Play.
Her last name is confirmed to be "Cattle" due to a movie poster art of Onesies done by Nick Rees (a lead background artist for the show).[1]

Script.jpg
The episode starts at the Heeler household, in the late evening.

Bandit: "Big sleep tonight, kids! The easter bunny's coming!"

Chilli: "I wonder how many eggs he'll leave you in your easter pouches!"

Bingo: "How do we know he won't forget us again?"

Bluey: "Yeah, like he did last year!"

Chilli: "Look, we've been through this. He didn't forget you! He was just late. He explained it all in his letter, remember?"

The shot moves to Bandit, who reads a note left on the wall from last Easter.

Bandit: "Dear Bluey and Bingo, so sorry I was late with your easter eggs. I had some family stuff on. I won't go into it. Big love, easter bunny. See? He was just busy!"

The Pups: "Okay."

Chilli: "We promise he won't forget this time."

Bandit and Chilli exit. Before she does however, she knocks over a bottle of confetti.

Chilli: "Oh goodness!"

Bandit: "Eh, we'll clean it up in the morning."

Chilli: "Night kids!"

Chilli and Bandit leave.

Bingo: "Bluey!"

Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo?"

Bingo: "Why did the easter bunny only forget us?"

Bluey: "I don't know!"

Bingo: "Do you think he'll remember us this time?"

Bluey: "Yeah, I do! Night, Bingo."

Bluey goes to sleep and Bingo stares up at the ceiling.

EPISODE TITLE: Easter

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Easter."

The shot cuts to Bluey waking up in the morning. She suddenly sits up.

Bluey: "It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!"

Bingo is startled and falls out of bed.

Bingo: "Did he come!?"

Bluey checks her easter pouch on her bed.

Bluey: "I'm not sure. I can't see any eggs!"

Bingo goes to check hers as well.

Bingo: "Mine's empty too! He forgot us again!"

Bluey: "Wait!"

Bingo: "What is it?"

Bingo runs over to Bluey, who pulls out a rainbow box out of her easter pouch, the only item in there.

Bluey: "It's a box!"

Bingo: "Eeee, the egg must be inside!"

Bluey opens the box and turns it over, only to find it empty.

Bluey: "It's empty!"

Bingo: "Awwww...."

Bluey: "Let's check yours again!"

Bluey & Bingo run over to the latter's bed, as Bingo reaches into her easter pouch and pulls out the letter B.

Bingo: "There is something! Oh, it's just a buh. He doesn't care about us!"

Discouraged, Bingo sits down with a saddened expression.

Bluey: "He does, Bingo! I think these are clues to where he's hidden our easter eggs!"

Bluey examines the items and tries to think of what it could mean.

Bluey: "Ooh, I know! Letter, box!

The Pups: "Letterbox!"

The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo, who are speeding down the hallways with the easter pouches strapped to their backs. They run down the stairs and outside to the letterbox.

Bingo: "Are the eggs in there?"

Bluey: "No, just a chatterbox."

Bingo: "Is it from the easter bunny!?"

Bluey: "It is! Look!"

Bingo squeals and Bluey tries solving it.

Bluey: "Easter...egg! Hmmm...what's your favorite color?"

Bingo: "Blue, like you!"

Bluey lifts up the blue colored flap on the chatterbox, and shows a picture of the easter egg and a chef hat.

Bluey: "It's a cook's hat, with an egg!"

Bingo: "What does it mean?"

Bluey: "Well, cooks work in the kitchen...maybe the easter eggs are in the kitchen!"

Bingo: "Yeah!"

The two laugh and run back inside the house.

Bingo: "The easter bunny knows my favorite color!"

Bluey: "I told you he cares about you!"

The pups run into the kitchen, where Bandit and Chilli are.

Bandit: "Happy Easter-- hey!"

Chilli: "Hey!"

Bluey and Bingo scramble to find the easter eggs, pushing Bandit and Chilli out of the way.

Bluey: "Sorry mum, we're looking for the easter eggs! They could be anywhere..."

Bingo: "Bluey look, it's an egg!"

Bingo points at the front of the refrigerator, where various fridge magnets and letters are shaped to form an easter egg.

The Pups: "Whoa..."

Bingo opens the fridge, and Bluey squeals excitedly, believing their hunt to be over. However, they find nothing.

Bluey: "Ah, they're not in here."

Bingo: "Awww..."

Bluey: "Wait, look at the normal eggs!"

Bingo: "Oh? The Easter Bunny doesn't bring normal eggs. He brings chocolate eggs!"

Bluey: "I know, but look at the end one!"

The camera zooms in on the "egg" that stands out from the rest, at the end of the carton.

Bingo: "Huh? One egg is a kiwi! Maybe there's chocolate inside!"

The shot cuts to Bandit, as Bluey and Bingo run to him.

Bluey: "Dad, is there chocolate in this?"

Bandit: "Let's see!"

Bluey gives Bandit the kiwi, who promptly cuts in half. However, its only a normal kiwi.

Bandit: "No, no chocolate."

Bingo: "Aww..."

Bluey thinks hard on what it could mean, being a potential clue for the easter eggs' true location.

Bluey: "I think I know where the eggs are!"

The pups run to the living room, where the kiwi rug resides.

Bluey: "The kiwi rug!"

Bingo: "I'll look under it!"

Bluey: "Hmm...I can't see them."

Bingo: "Aww...Maybe the easter bunny just likes other children more than me."

Bluey: "No, Bingo, he likes you! It's just that..-"

Bingo: "Ah, look!"

Bingo points to the kiwi rug, where they spot an arrow.

Bluey: "It's an arrow!"

Bingo: "It's pointing to the backyard!"

Bluey: "Come on!"

The pups run outside into the backyard, where they split up to find it.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo checks the sand castle, and Bluey runs to examine another area.

Bingo: "I don't remember that sand castle."

Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Are the poinsettia flowers normally in a straight line?

Bingo: "Hmm...Usually they're more higgledy piggledy."

Bluey: "I think it's a picture."

Bingo: "A picture of what?"

Bluey: "I don't know! But I know how to find out, come on!"

The pups run up the stairs onto the top of the second floor deck. They go to check the poinsettia petals.

Bluey: "Wow."

Bingo: "It's a castle! Our eggs must be in the castle!"

Bluey: "There's a castle in London! We've gotta get to the airport!"

Bingo: "No, Bluey! I think it's a different castle!"

The shot cuts back to the sand castle in the backyard.

Bingo: "I think it's this one!"

Bluey bashes straight into the castle, destroying it. Afterwards, she begins digging a hole into the sand, squealing in excitement.

Bluey: "I hit something!"

Bingo: "Is it chocolate!?"

Bluey: "It is, it is!"

Bingo squeals. Have they finally found the easter eggs?

Bluey: "Wait...it isn't. It's toilet paper."

Bingo: "Awww!"

Bluey: "Hang on, look! Eggs! It's another clue! Come on!"

Bluey runs off, with Bingo following. She falls into the hole Bluey dug, and giggles. The shot cuts to the bathroom, where they begin looking again.

Bluey: "You look over there!"

Bingo: "There's no eggs in here!"

Bluey: "There must be! Toilet paper belongs in the toilet! Unless...Oh, no!"

Bingo: "What?"

Bluey: "They might be in Dad's toilet!"

The pups gasp, with the camera zooming in on their fearful faces. The shot then cuts to Bandit on the toilet. Bluey and Bingo peek in.

Bandit: "Ugh...Bandit!"

Bluey: "Augh, it stinks!"

Bingo: "How are we gonna find the next clue?"

Bluey: "Someone has to go in there!"

Bingo: "But it stinks so much we'll die!"

Bluey: "I know!"

Bingo: "Aww...there will be no Easter."

Bluey: "Yes there will be, Bingo. I'm going in!"

Bluey enters the bathroom, holding her breath.

Bluey: "Ugh, it stinks. I can't...do it..."

She falls to the ground, before she suddenly pops back up.

Bluey: "Wait!"

She looks at the mirror, where a drawing of Bluey and Bingo's bedroom window is present. The shot then cuts back to Bluey exiting the bathroom, coughing and catching a breath of fresh air.

Bingo: "Did you find it?"

Bluey gives Bingo a small note with a drawing of the window.

Bingo: "Oh, I know what this is!"

The shot cuts to the pups running into their bedroom. Bingo runs up to the window and holds the note over it.

Bingo: "It's our window! They must be in here!"

Bluey: "But we've already looked here! I don't understand!"

Bingo: "I do. He forgot us again."

Bingo sits down, discouraged. Bluey accepts defeat and sits down with her.

Bluey: "Maybe you're right, Bingo."

Bingo: "It's my fault, Bluey. I'm just a small, forgettable child."

Bluey: "No you're not, Bingo! You're a great child!"

Bingo: "Really?"

Bluey: "Yes, you're smart! You figured out the castle clue all by yourself!"

Bingo: "Yeah, I did!"

Bluey: "It's me who's forgettable."

Bingo: "You are not! You're brave! You went into Dad's stinky toilet!"

Bluey: "Oh yeah, I did!"

Bluey stands back up.

Bluey: "We're not forgettable!"

Bingo: "Yeah, we're rememberable!

The pups hug each other.

Bingo: "Happy easter, Bluey."

Bluey: "Happy easter, Bing-oooh! Look!"

Bluey points to the easter decorations on the carpet. They're formed to resemble footprints.

Bingo: "Footprints! Bunny footprints!"

The Pups: "Easter Bunny footprints!"

The two squeal excitedly, running to follow the path. The path leads them to Bandit's workroom, where a lamp is set up right above the yoga ball. As Bluey moves the ball aside, they have finally found the easter basket, full of chocolates and other goodies.

Bingo: "He remembered us!"

END CREDITS

The credits music is a soft and peaceful resolution to the episode's main soundtrack, which has been building up to the hunt for the easter baskets all this time.

AD
Appearance
Chippy is a Borzoi with a beige body. The tip of his tail, his feet, his mustache and his "curly mullet" pouf is brown beige. His nose is brown. Chippy's eyes have not been shown so far. Chippy is often seen sporting sunglasses on the top of his head. He also has a black tiger face tattoo on his right upper arm and a cherry tattoo on his left upper arm.

Personality
Chippy is a laid back dog, but his first appearance is shadowed by an ongoing conflict with Cherry.

Biography
Chippy works as a tradie (tradesman) under Sparky. He has a close connection with Cherry and the two are in contact often. Cherry drives Chippy to work at the Heeler's house. Chippy is one of the few characters in the Blueyverse that wears clothes, however, they are work clothes, so he likely doesn't wear it at all times.

Trivia
Chippy is initially given the nickname Chocolate Milk in the episode Tradies.
Chippy is seen getting a lift from Cherry or Sparky
It is implied that Chippy probably lost his driving license from either doing something silly with his car or Driving Under the Influence (DUI)

Appearance
Nana is a Blue Heeler with blue, light blue and very dark blue fur. She has blue legs, arms, tail tip, torso and inner ears, light blue feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, and very dark blue tail stem, left and right head and outer ears. She also has a black nose and wears pink glasses. She has a pudgier build than other members of the family.

Biography
Nana is the grandmother of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks, the mother of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the mother-in-law of Chilli and Trixie and the wife of Bob. She has no known friends as of yet.

Trivia
Nana has retired to Gold Coast, QLD (Which is a real place like Brisbane).
She is voiced by Joe Brumm’s mother, Chris Brumm.
She is also the first character to share the same name with her voice actress.
She is also the second character to be voiced by a member of Joe Brumm's family, the first was Stripe, who was voiced by Dan Brumm.
Compared to the rest of the Heeler family, her design is plump, rather than rectangle shaped.
Her real name was finally revealed in the episode Handstand.
Younger versions of her can be seen in the flashbacks in Baby Race and Fairytale.
She calls Bandit "Bandy" (as revealed in Christmas Swim) and Stripe "Stripy" (as revealed in Handstand).
So far Trixie is the only family member who calls her by her real name.

She is the only member of Bandit's immediate family to be female.
"Double Babysitter" reveals that she once babysat Bluey and Bingo overnight, but due to her bad hearing, she turned the television up too loudly and woke Bluey. In addition, the show Chris was watching scared Bluey, which led her to dislike babysitter putdowns. However, after being babysat by Rad and Frisky, who did not watch loud TV at night, this association went away.
"Baby Race" reveals that she has a way of teaching babies to walk, which is putting olive oil on their knees so they can't crawl. Chilli and Bandit, however, do not like this method.

AD
Appearance
Chunky Chimp is a pink-and-tan monkey with a tan patch on his stomach and around his entire face. His ears and part of his legs and arms are also tan. The rest of his body is pink. Chunky has a round nose with two nostrils that are (compared to the size of the nose) are small. He has two dark-magenta eyebrows.

Personality
As seen as in the episode he stars in, he is inventive, and his curiosity led him to go to the “groundlands”, which is just really the ground. As noted by the Magic Pinecone, he shows bravery.

Biography
Not much is known about his family or friends. One of his friends(?) can be seen up in a tree with him during the start of the Chunky Chimp movie.

Trivia
The animals in the Chunky Chimp movie are some of the only anthropomorphic animals to not be a dog.
Chutney Chimp appears to be a separate franchise with a confusingly similar name.
In the 'Bluey's Bus' playset, the Bluey and Bingo figures are wearing Chunky Chimp shirts, and the back of the bus features an advertisement for the movie.

Administrators notes
There is a current controversy on the name of this character from the mentions and dubbing during season 1-2. On the current Australian showings the name is different, so the determining factor will be resolved with the worldwide release of season 3, the name will be either corrected or left as is when that happens.

Trivia
He is voiced by series director Richard Jeffery.
In Spy Game, Bandit slaps his leg saying "mozzie!" when Bluey and Mackenzie pull a hair off him. Some fans have misheard him as saying "Fozzie", believing that it's the name of Mackenzie's Dad in a similar fashion to fans mishearing Gruber's name as Rupert due to the I-view subtitles. "Mozzie" is Australian slang for Mosquito as Bandit believed he was bitten by one. His name however has yet to be revealed.
In "Curry Quest", when Bandit is saying goodbye to Mackenzie and his parents, he refers to them as the "Border Collies" or perhaps a variation such as "Border-Collies". This would imply that that is their family surname.

Personality
Muffin can be very loud and energetic no matter what mood she is in. Due to her young age, she often has trouble understanding things like how to play charades the proper way.

AD
Appearance
Pom Pom is a white pom-pom-like Pomeranian with pink inner ears and a black nose. She bears little resemblance with a real Pomeranian though.

Personality
Pom Pom is a really energetic puppy, and will always be trying to get in whatever situation Bluey is pulling off. In the episode seesaw, she gets self conscious about her size when she isn't able to get off a pole, and cant get up a little slope and she runs to her mom, crying a little bit. Later in the episode, when she is needed for seesawing Bluey’s dad (Bandit) off, she climbed up the seesaw, but struggles in the process. As she climbs up the seesaw, she trips and slides down, Bandit almost grabs her, but she perseveres and keeps climbing. Eventually reaching the top, and making Bandit side lift up, making her, Bluey, Bingo and her friends victorious. In a couple of minutes (or maybe hours), she is then seen playing a game involving one spider and a few bugs, presumably flys, with the Heeler sisters, and Judo. After asking Bingo for a turn of being the spider, Judo criticizes Pom Pom about her size and says she can't because of that, Pom Pom then gets upset and disagrees, Bingo and Bluey also disagree as well. It looks like now she is ok with her small stature.

Biography
Pom Pom is friends to Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, Coco, Snickers. She is daughter of Pom Pom's Mum but has no known Dad.

Appearances
S2E28 - Seesaw
S3E9 - Curry Quest (end credits cameo)

Trivia
Pom Pom is sometimes seen to have a dog-like posture like Socks.
She is 5 and her birthday is the 16th of an unknown month.
Although she is the same age as Bingo, she was never seen in Kindy.
It might be possible that she is home-schooled.
It is also possible that she might be in a different school.
In Pass the Parcel she gets what resembles a blue chattermax.
Pom Pom's name is an obvious reference to her species, a pomeranian. Her physical appearance is also similar to that of a decorative ball or tuft of fibrous material of the same name.
Her name is shared with Pom-Pom from Pup Academy, another Dog related show.
Some fans have pointed out that in Seesaw she could have just used the lower end of the slope.

Radley "Rad" Heeler is a secondary and recurring character that appeared in multiple episodes of Bluey.

AD
Appearance
Rad resembles a combination of Bluey and Bingo. The upper half of his body down to his chest, his shoulders, ears, back and tail have the colouration of a Red Heeler and his forearms, stomach and legs have the colouration of a Blue Heeler. He has long hair on the right side of his head. He also has white dots on his chest (or chest hair) on his stomach on the beige-coloured row.

Biography
Rad is the older brother of Bandit and Stripe, the brother-in-law of Chilli Heeler and Trixie, the uncle of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, and Socks, and the oldest son of Bob and Chris. He was one of the guests at Bandit and Chilli’s wedding, during which he “probably” fell in the pool. As a result of working on an oil rig, Rad rarely saw his nieces, usually visiting only at Christmas.[1] He is known to have posed for at least one family photo, with his parents and brothers, along with the latter’s wives and children.[2]

During one of his visits, Rad agreed to babysit Bluey and Bingo while their parents went out for the night. Though this would require putting the pair to bed, Rad had no objections, and playfully sneaked into the house after ringing the doorbell. He surprised an excited Bingo by grabbing her from behind, and then calls her Bluey before saying that Bluey is a boy. While Bingo is thrilled to have Rad taking care of them, Bluey isn’t pleased with the prospect of a babysitter putdown.

Unfazed, Rad tries to get Bluey excited about the idea, asking who could be better to handle a babysitter putdown. At that moment, Bluey’s godmother Frisky walks in, and Rad seems stunned at the sight of her. After the pair are introduced, with Frisky recalling seeing Rad at the wedding, Frisky prepares to leave, having not gotten a message from Chilli about canceling her babysitting duties for the night. Bingo objects, wanting Frisky to join Rad in babysitting them, and Rad agrees readily to the unusual arrangement.

After waving goodbye to Bandit and Chilli, Rad suggests that the girls get to know him and Frisky by playing twenty questions. As the girls ask about Rad’s life, he questions whether his job might not be the reason not only for the rare number of times he’s seen them, but also for his single status. He turns the game towards Frisky, and the pair learn that they have a few things in common. After Frisky mentions the recent end of her relationship with Bosco, however, Rad spares her further embarrassment by suggesting that they play a game in the backyard.

Rad proves to be unfamiliar with any of Bandit or Chilli’s games, but Frisky comes to the rescue by proposing torch mouse. The adults take on the role of cats, and Frisky eventually tackles Rad. Later, the two help Bluey and Bingo brush their teeth, and Rad notices that Bluey still seems unhappy. He suggests that he give the new experience a chance, in the hopes that she might get used to and like it. Rad illustrates his point by holding her upside down, allowing her to stand and even sit on the ceiling.

Afterwards, Frisky and Rad tell the girls a story, with Rad playing the role of a prince who defeats a dragon with a punch. However, “Princess” Frisky is uninterested in being rescued, much to the amusement of the girls. Following some banter and the girls’ pleading, though, Frisky agrees that the prince and princess can get married, much to Rad’s pleasure. The adults settle the girls down for bed, with Bingo falling asleep before Rad has even realized it.

Bluey is still hesitant, and with some questions Rad and Frisky discover the cause. It seems that Bluey’s last babysitter putdown with Rad’s mother went poorly, due to Chris’ failing hearing. Her loud late night TV watching woke up Bluey, who was scared by Chris’ choice of programming. With kind words, Rad and Frisky encourage her to give the experience another chance, settling on the floor between her and Bingo’s beds as they wait for her to fall asleep. Afterwards, the two talk quietly on the porch outside, not noticing when Bluey awakens briefly, observes their conversation with a smile, and then returns to sleep.[3]

Rad and Frisky soon became romantically involved, and they went on a trip around Christmas. This caused them to be away during the family Christmas party the rest of the Heelers had on Christmas Day. Rad and Frisky made a video call to their family and friends, with Rad questioning Stripe’s abilities as a cook. Muffin broke in to show Rad one of her presents, and Chris expressed the wish that Rad and Frisky could be at the party, which Rad reciprocated.

Later, Rad left and leaped into the pool he and Frisky were visiting. This occurred while Frisky was chatting with Bluey and her new toy, Bartleby, who according to Bluey is having a rough first Christmas with the Heelers. Frisky used Rad’s performance, which he accompanied with a shout, to prove her point that the Heelers “are a bit crazy.” Rad playfully objected to this statement. He later rejoined Frisky at the bar, pulling her into a one-armed hug as he did so.[4]

Trivia
Rad Heeler didn't make a physical appearance until the second half of Season 2.
In fact, his first appearance was in photos.
Rad was redesigned from the picture to a new design. Originally having his blue fur up to his head in the picture.
Radley's name is pun on the dog breed "Red Heeler".
In Double Babysitter, he is shown to be a reckless driver, by him parking his ute messily on the Heeler’s front yard. The same episode reveals that he uses almond milk shampoo, and that he wants to have children.
A preteen version of Rad can be seen in Fairytale.
Rad is revealed to be the oldest brother out of Bandit and Stripe in Fairytale.
It's possible that he is sort of absentminded frequently. Examples include him mistaking Bingo for Bluey, calling Bluey a boy (her having to correct him that she is a girl), and him saying, "Go where?" when Bingo and Bluey want to play “Come here and go away”.
Unlike his younger brothers, he is clean shaven and does not have whiskers.
As of Christmas Swim, Rad and Frisky are not married, but may be engaged. Their wedding is likely to be the subject of a future episode. In an interview with Gotta Be Done[5], Joe Brumm stated:
"A wedding hasn't happened between Rad and Frisky. But, I think, Christmas Swim, yeah, the idea is that the relationship's started, maybe they're engaged. And I love the idea of caricaturing an Australian wedding from the kid's point of view. [...] I'd like to try that."

Unlike his siblings and parents, Rad is a Red Heeler in a family of Blue Heelers, hinting that he could have been born by another Red Heeler, from another parent, he could possibly be adopted, he could have a gene mutation, he could be artificially insemitated, or he could be sperm donored.
It’s also possible Bandit’s family has a family member who is a Red Heeler.
Rad is also the first Red Heeler to not be from Chilli's side.

Trivia
In the show’s very early development, Rusty was originally going to be the main protagonist, though Bluey quickly was chosen to be the main protagonist by the time the first pilot was finished.
Rusty being one of the first characters created also explains why he is seen in the 2nd pilot's intro, but most other side-characters aren't.
Many fans consider him to be a male counterpart of Bluey (having the exact same design as her, but with a completely different colour scheme).
According to the official website, he rides a motorbike, though this has yet to be seen on-screen in the show.
At one point, the official website stated Rusty was one of Bluey's cousins. But for whatever reason, the description was changed to Rusty being one of Bluey's friends instead. It has since been debated on if Rusty and Bluey being cousins is true or not.
His mother made her physical debut in Explorers.

Rusty's Dad is a Red Kelpie with red and tan fur. He has tan feet, hands and bottom muzzle, and red ears, tail, head and top muzzle. He also has a dark red nose and wears a green army cap and camouflage army overalls.

Biography
Rusty’s Dad serves in the army. He is the father of Rusty, but has no known friends as of yet.

Appearances
S2E16 - Army
Trivia
He is a soldier in the Australian Army.
Specifically, his green beret would suggest that he is a commando of either the 1st Commando Regiment (of the Australian Army Reserve) or the 2nd Commando Regiment (of the Australian Army)[1]. However, Rusty's Dad may have been given a green beret by the character designers for trivial or aesthetic purposes.
His voice actor served in the Australian military.
He is voiced by musician, actor, songwriter and producer Anthony Field, also known as the Blue Wiggle, who also voices Postie.
Before becoming a musician, from 1982 to 1985, Anthony Field had served in the 5th/7th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, first as infantryman and rifleman, before becoming a stretcher-bearer and ambulance driver. While serving in the army, Field had also played the bagpipes during training missions and parades. In July 1985, Field suffered a back injury during training, resulting in the end of Field's military service.
His back is only shown as seen in Army.

His name (and design) could be a reference to the candy, Snickers.
Because his mother has a different fur color than Snickers, this may indicate what Snickers' father looks like, who has yet to be mentioned or to make an appearance.
In Typewriter, Snickers had trouble sitting down, but in Baby Race, he could sit just fine.

Bluey.tv Description
"Muffin’s baby sister is just starting to talk."

Appearance
Socks is a Blue Heeler with three different shades of blue all over her fur and a bit of dark brown at the start of her tail, and light brown after it. She has a black nose and bright beige for the insides of her ears. She has dark blue on both of her ears and a splash on the left side of her head and a subtle spot connected to the start of her tail. She has bright blue for her socks, stomach, and tail and a stripe in the middle of her forehead. She also has freckles on her muzzle.

Biography
Socks is the daughter of Stripe and Trixie, the cousin of Bluey and Bingo and the younger sister of Muffin. She is the niece of Bandit and Chilli and the granddaughter of Bob and Chris.

Personality
At the beginning of Season 1, Socks acts like a regular puppy. She barks, walks on all fours, and bites toys and people. She sometimes growls and bites people including her father and Bandit. Due to her young age, she has trouble understanding what she does wrong like biting Bluey, but can also be quite sensitive too.

By Season 2, Socks can walk and talk like the rest of her family, but still has a few dog-like traits.

Trivia
In her first appearance, fans thought that Socks was male. Similar to Bluey and Bingo. However, this was proven wrong.
In the Dutch dub, however, Socks is male.
Her name likely refers to how her paws are a lighter shade of blue than the rest of her coat and have stripes above them, making her look like she's wearing socks.
Her favourite coloured capsicum is green (bell pepper in international editions).
She is young and is still learning to act like her family.
In Honk and Horsey Ride, Stripe calls her Rock-Socks.
She can say “Green Capsicum” and "Green Pepper" vaguely but pronounces it as "Gleen pepper"/"gleen capshimun", but can say “Ballerina” clearly, as seen in Charades.
In Christmas Swim, she can say "Pizza" and "Merry Christmas."
Socks walks on all fours throughout Season 1 and most of Season 2. However, in Baby Race, Bluey and her friends were all seen learning to walk as human babies.
Some people theorized this was a genetic trait, but some theorized that Socks was autistic.
Despite Bluey having a crib in Baby Race, Socks had a dog bed in Verandah Santa. This may indicate that this happens often.
It is possible that Socks was going through a phase where she acted like a dog.
Recent information concludes that there was an error in Baby Race where the team forgot to make the babies walk like puppies
In Backpackers and Charades, Socks can be seen with a straight and upright body compared to her usual dog-like posture.
In Christmas Swim, she is seen walking on two legs.
Her, Pom Pom, Lulu and Chloe's baby brother are the youngest characters in Bluey.
She is one of the few characters in the series to have a lying down sad pose, as seen in Verandah Santa. The other one being Bingo Heeler, in Yoga Ball.
In the new short, Honk, it is shown that Socks is finally now able to talk and walk.
When Socks grew into a toddler, the stripes on her paws disappeared.

Appearances
S02E01 - Dance Mode (Debut)

Trivia
In the episode Movies, it might’ve been a mistake to put him with Grey Kid. As the next scene we see Grey Kid with Grey Dad instead of Yellow Dad. This might’ve just been an accident during animation, though.
In the epidose Dance Mode, we see Yellow Dad driving a bus. This might be their job.

AD
Description
Unicorse is a puppet who annoys Chilli, he is puppeteered by Bandit and has a gold horn on his head. He always tries to interrupt Chilli while she reads a storybook to Bluey to make her go to sleep. But he can't stop talking, and nearly wakes up Bingo. Unicorse keeps on stuffing up Chilli's Name calling her Willy, Billy, Silly, etc. Unicorse has a lawyer, who tries to sue Bluey for "karate chopping" him and giving him whiplash.

Shaun is an Emu that has a taste for trouble. Despite not having appeared in previous episodes, people's reaction to seeing Shaun implies that Bandit brought him frequently in the past, and that his chaotic nature was well known through the neighborhood. This is evidenced by Pat's immediate recognition of Shaun after noticing his erratic behaviors, and Chilli's general distaste for the creature.

Appearences
S01E15 - Shaun (As Shaun)
S03E08 - Unicorse (As Unicorse)
S03E29 - Puppets (As Unicorse)
Trivia
Unicorse
Unicorse's favorite food is Children. Just kidding, it's chicken bucket.
Unicorse was not aware he was a puppet until the episode Puppets.
Unicorse does not know how to read.
This is most likely because he is a puppet and he is controlled by Bandit.

Biography
Wendy is Judo’s mother and Bluey and Bingo’s next door neighbour.

She is occasionally witness to and disturbed by the antics of her neighbours (most notably Bandit's) as a recurring joke in the series.

Trivia
She was initially voiced by Beth Durack, an animator of the TV show. Emily Tehany voices her now as of in Sheep Dog.
She speaks with an upper class English accent (despite both her voice actors' natural accents being Australian) as she originated from the UK. Her daughter, however, does not.
Her car is featured in Dance Mode. It is blue and has a custom number plate that reads “W3ND73”.
In Dad Baby, she sings "I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside", a popular British music hall song, written in 1907 by John H. Glover-Kind and made famous by music hall singer Mark Sheridan who first recorded it in 1909.[1]
She made five lasagnas for the Heeler Family when Bluey was born, as revealed in Sticky Gecko.
She possesses great strength as shown in Ragdoll when she lifts Bandit into his car.
She is also revealed to be a talented singer in the same episode when she sings Down by the Banks of the Hanky Panky with Bluey and Bingo as she drives them to the shops.
In Dirt, Wendy is shown to have a dislike for her long hair, finding uncomfortable how much work it required to get cleaned and how it would get in the way during some of her chores. After noticing how Judo wouldn't have fun with her friends because of her own long hair, Wendy gets the courage to finally cut it, inspiring her daughter to do the same.
Unlike actual Chow Chows, which have blue tongues, both Wendy and Judo's tongues are red.
Despite Bluey and Bingo calling other characters' parents '_ mum' '_ dad', the two call her by her name.
