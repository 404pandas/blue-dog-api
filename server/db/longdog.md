Trivia
The first official acknowledge of this Easter Egg happens on the official Bluey twitter on February 15 of 2022.
An episode with no dog listed does not means it doesn't have one, it only means that none was found yet. If you find one, feel free to add them on along with which episode in chronological order in the right place.
There is also no confirmation if there is at least one in every episode, so they may have none.
Some long dogs appear consistently throughout many episodes, like the Magnet dog on the fridge and the Brown dog on the top of the Playroom shelf, making them look like normal objects.
Although, some late episodes evidence that they may not really be noticed by people and may not be real.
A Tennis ball and Chattermax also seem to appear consistently throughout many episodes in various locations, but it looks less of a Easter Egg and more of a joke background object.
However, on the second pack of episodes for the third season, Chattermax also starts appearing in numerous unusual places, like it is being hidden.
