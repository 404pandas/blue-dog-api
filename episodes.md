Trivia
The plot of this episode is likely an allusion to the story of Kisa Gotami which is one of the more famous stories in Buddhism.
This is the only episode to have the title card played on a screen in an episode instead of being completely on the screen.
This is also the only episode to be inside a screen.
Fittingly, Bluey would say, "This story is called..." when introducing the story's title.
The title of the video Bingo, Chilli, and the nurse watches is also the name of the episode.
Running gags:
Muffin saying her lines wrong (usually by forgetting to say Bluey's stage name).
Bandit constantly fixing the camera or working on the video.
This marks the only episode where Trixie, Lucky, and Mackenzie are shown to wear some form of clothing (even though it’s for the stage video that Bluey made for Bingo), in this case purple underpants and a dress (for Aunt Trixie as the Wise Old Wolfhound).
Long Dog: The original long dog. It appears spread across two pages of a book that Barnicus (Bluey) reads to Bumpy (Socks.)
This is the first time the long dog appears in the Heeler home outside of the playroom. However it is only in illustration form and not the typical toy form.
It is never stated what illness Bingo has, though she is going home the next day, indicating that it's in its final stages.
Muffin stated that she had rabies the previous week. In actuality, rabies can't spread in Australia (though related diseases can) and it is lethal. She probably did not know how rabies worked due to her young age.

Script.jpg
The episode opens with an establishing shot of the window of a hospital room. The windowsill has some get well soon cards - one with a fairy bread godmother, one with googley-eyed bandages, and one with a teddy bear wearing a bandage. Beside the window is a mylar heart baloon and a bouquet of flowers.

The shot changes. It is now centered on Bingo, sitting on a hospital bed. Behind the head of the bed is a large picture of tropical fish. A tablet is sitting on the foot of the bed. Chilli sits at her bedside, and a doctor is holding a stethoscope on Bingo's back.

Doctor: Okay, take a big breath in for me, Bingo.

Bingo takes a deep breath.

Doctor: Ooh, that was a big one.

Bingo: (whispering to Chilli) Can you ask her if I can go home?

Chilli: Do you think we can go home soon, Doctor?

The doctor makes a note on Bingo's chart.

Doctor: We might just keep you in for another night, Bingo, just to keep an eye on you.

The doctor leaves. Bingo hugs her own knees.

Bingo: I wanna go home.

Chilli: (sighs) I know, kid.

Chilli pats Bingo's back.

Chilli: Me too.

Bingo: It's not fair.

Chilli: Yeah, I guess it isn't. But here we are.

The tablet chimes.

Chilli: Oh, look.

Chilli picks up the tablet.

Chilli: Dad sent us a message.

Chilli swipes to open the message. The tablet chimes again.

Chilli It's a video!

Bingo: Can I push play?

Chilli Yeah. Go on.

The shot changes to show the tablet from Bingo's perspective. Bingo taps the play button. The episode title card appears, framed in the tablet.

TITLE CARD - Bumpy and the Wise Old Wolfhound

Bluey: [voiceover] This story is called Bumpy and the Wise Old Wolfhound.

The tablet cuts to a blurry shot of Bluey wearing purple underpants. The shot zooms back, and the shot goes in and out of focus as the camera adjusts automatically. Bluey is standing in front of the front steps of the Heeler house.

Bluey: Hi! I'm Barnicus.

The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital.

Bingo: It's Bluey!

Chilli: Yeah!

Bingo: (giggles)

Chilli: Why is she wearing purple underpants?

The shot changes to show the tablet again.

Bluey: [voiceover] Once, there was a young lady called Barnicus.

Bluey pulls up the waistband of her underpants.

The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital.

Bingo: (giggles) Barnicus!

The shot changes back to the tablet. The camera zooms in until the video fills the frame.

Bluey: [voiceover] What Barnicus wanted more than anything in the world was a puppy!

Bluey: (as Barnicus) I really want a puppy!

The scene changes to the playroom. Bandit (who is also wearing purple underpants) is sitting at the counter of a produce stand. Bluey enters, carrying a shopping basket. Both of them are staring at the camera and smiling unnaturally.

Bluey: [voiceover] All day, she would say the same thing.

Bluey, who is looking at the camera instead of where she's walking, bumps into the produce stand.

Bandit: (woodenly, as Shopkeeper) Here's... your carrots... Barnicus.

Bandit sets a pair of wooden carrots on the counter. Bluey picks one up and considers it.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) These carrots are nice, but what I really want is my very own puppy.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Maybe you should wish upon a star!

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay.

With a star wipe, the scene changes to Bluey in front of a blue sheet with stars. A Christmas ornament star hangs from a string, swaying.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, twinkly star, please may I have a puppy?

Something wooden clatters to the floor offscreen. Half of the backdrop droops, revealing Bandit, who is holding the broomstick that suspends the star.

Bandit: Argh!

The scene cuts to Bluey in her bed. She pantomimes waking up and yawning.

Bluey: [voiceover] And then the next morning, she woke up...

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, my wish came true!

Bluey points, and the camera pans over. Socks is struggling at the foot of the bed, and we can see Stripe's arms as he tries to hold her still.

Socks: (snarls)

Bluey: (as Barnicus) My very own puppy!

Socks bites Stripe on the hand.

Stripe: Arghh--

The camera beeps, cutting off the scene mid-yell. Now Bluey is holding Socks, who is happily eating a chocolate chip cookie out of Stripe's hand.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) I will call you Bumpy.

The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital. A nurse is taking Bingo's blood pressure, and watching the tablet over her shoulder.

Bingo: Hee hee, Bumpy!

Nurse: Why is everyone wearing purple pants?

The shot changes back to the produce stand. Bluey is dragging a struggling Socks on a leash.

Bluey: [voiceover] Barnicus and Bumpy went everywhere together.

Socks: (snarls)

Bluey: (as Barnicus) I'll have some carrots, please, shopkeeper. Bumpy loves carrots.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Oh, yes. What a lovely --

Socks darts forward and bites Bandit on the ankle.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) puppy! Ow! So gentle and mild! Owww!

The camera falls on its side as Stripe drops it and enters the frame to break up Socks and Bandit.

Stripe: Cut! Stop it!

The shot changes to Bingo, Chilli, and the nurse in the hospital.

All: (laugh)

Bandit: (from tablet) Owww!

The shot changes to Bluey and Stripe skipping through a field.

Bluey: [voiceover] Barnicus was finally happy.

Socks' eyes widen, then she stops moving. She squats.

Socks: (grunting) Hueah!

Socks pans out of frame as the camera continues following Bluey. Just as Bluey notices what's going on behind her, the scene cuts.

The shot changes to Bluey in her bed, and again she pantomimes waking up and yawning.

Bluey: [voiceover] Then, one day, Barnicus woke up to discover that Bumpy was very sick.

Bluey puts her hands to her face in shock. The camera pans to show Socks, panting happily and covered in colorful dots.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, no! Bumpy's sick!

The scene transitions with a clock wipe. Still on Bluey's bed, Bluey is sadly patting Socks, who is chewing on her own leg. Outside the window, Bandit is holding a piece of cardboard with a sunny sky painted on it, and Muffin holds a piece of cardboard with a moonlight night sky. They shuffle past the window one after the other to show the passage of time.

Bluey: [voiceover] Lots of days and nights went by, but Bumpy wasn't getting better.

Muffin trips, dropping her cardboard. Bandit peers over the top of his cardboard, looking a bit concerned. The shot changes to show just Bluey and Socks, who is now chewing on her elbow.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) It's not fair.

The scene changes to the back yard. Lucky is fishing in a wading pool with a magnetic fishing toy. He's wearing purple underpants. Bluey carries Socks (who is now tightly swaddled in a blanket) into the shot.

Bluey: [voiceover] Barnicus wandered around looking for help...

Lucky looks at Socks, and shakes his head sadly.

The scene cuts to Mackenzie, who is wearing purple underpants and hammering on the fence with an inflatable hammer.

Bluey: [voiceover] ...but no one knew how to fix Socks --

Mackenzie looks at socks, and shrugs and shakes his head.

Bluey: [voiceover] --Oh, I mean Bumpy.

The scene cuts to the produce stand again. The shopkeeper's leg is covered in colorful bandages.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Shopkeeper, please can you help Bumpy?

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sorry, I only know how to sell carrots.

Bandit holds up a wooden carrot to illustrate.

The scene transitions with a comb wipe. At the base of the stairs in the green living room, Muffin is standing on a cushion. She's wearing a chef's toque and is stirring the "contents" of a wide china vase with a wooden spoon. She is also wearing purple underpants. The china vase wobbles as Muffin stirs.

Bluey: [voiceover] Finally, she asked the baker.

The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is gone.

Chilli: Oh, no, Muffin. That's my good vase.

The scene cuts back to Muffin. Bluey enters carrying Socks, who is still swaddled. Muffin waves.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Hi, Bluey. Did you want pancakes?

The scene cuts back to Bingo.

Bingo: (giggles) Muffin, her name is Barnicus!

The scene cuts back to Muffin.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Why doon't... um...

The camera beeps, and Stripe appears behind Muffin. Bluey looks bored, and Socks is asleep.

Stripe: (whispering) Why don't you try the Wise Old Wolfhound, Barnicus?

The camera beeps again, and Stripe is gone. Bluey and Socks are alert again. Muffin, however, is staring at someone behind her.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Why don't you try the Wise Old Wolfhound, Bluey?

Stripe: (whispering from off camera) Barnicus!

Muffin: (confused) I mean, Barnicus...?

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, yes, of course! Thanks, baker lady!

Bluey runs off with Socks. Muffin puts down the spoon and approaches the camera.

Muffin: Was that all right, Dad?

The camera beeps, and Muffin is back on the cushion. She waves with the wooden spoon, knocking over the vase.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Good luck, Bluey!

The vase breaks.

The scene cuts back to the hospital.

Bingo: (giggles)

Chilli puts her head in her hands.

Chilli: Oh, Muffin!

The scene cuts back to Muffin, who is staring at the remains of the vase. After a moment, Bandit leans into the frame.

Bandit: We can edit that bit out, right?

The camera beeps, and the scene cuts back Bluey, who is running across the back yard carrying Socks.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Don't worry, Bumpy. The Wise Old Wolfhound will be able to magic you better.

Bluey reaches her destination: a tent. The tent has been decorated with stars and flags. The salt lamp, a crystal ball, and a geode have been set in front of it as "magical artifacts".

Bluey enters the tent.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) (gasps)

Inside the tent is Trixie. She's sitting in lotus position, wearing a flower crown and a bathrobe, which she is wearing over one shoulder in imitation of a Buddhist monk's robe. She is in a spotlight. She opens her eyes and waves to Bluey - as she does so, a psychedelic filter is applied to the video.

The scene cuts to Bingo.

Bingo: Hee hee! It's Aunt Trixie!

The scene cuts back to the tent. A C.H. monogram is sometimes visible on Trixie's bathrobe.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, Wise Old Wolfhound, Bumpy is sick!

Bluey puts Socks down on the floor, and sits down cross-legged.

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Oh, poor little fella.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) It's not fair! Please, can you help him?

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) I am not a puppy doctor.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Please, can you magic him better?

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Magic?

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Please, please, please!

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Okay, little one. Perhaps there is a way I can help.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, wonderful!

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Bring me a pair of purple underpants.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay!

Without hesitation, Bluey stands and takes off her underpants.

The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is watching over Bingo's shoulder again.

Bingo: (giggles)

Chilli: Ah.

Chilli and Nurse: Now it's making sense.

The scene cuts back to the Wise Old Wolfhound's tent.

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Whoa! I'm not finished. I need a pair of purple underpants from someone who's never been sick.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Never been sick?

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Never been sick.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh.

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Have you ever been sick?

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, yes. I had a runny nose last year.

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Well, it will have to be someone else's purple underpants, I'm afraid.

Bluey puts her underpants back on.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) No problems! I'll get some from someone in town.

Bluey picks up Socks and runs out.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) We'll be right back!

Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Good luck, Barnicus!

The scene cuts back to the produce stand.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Shopkeeper, shopkeeper! The wise old Wolfhound's gonna help my puppy! I just need a pair of purple pants.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sure! I'll give you anything if it helps Bumpy.

Bandit stands up and yanks down his underwear.

The scene cuts to the hospital.

Bingo: (giggles)

Chilli and Nurse: Ewww!

Chilli: Oh, dear.

The scene cuts to the produce stand. Bandit hands Bluey his underpants.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) There you go.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Thanks.

Bluey takes the underpants and turns to leave.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Wait. I forgot to ask. Have you ever been sick?

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sick? Oh. Well, yes. I've got --

The camera suddenly zooms in on Bandit's face as a dramatic music sting plays.

Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) -- bum worms.

The scene cuts to the hospital.

Bingo: (gasps)

Chilli: Ewww!

Nurse: (laughs)

Chilli: Good grief!

Bingo: She can't use those pants.

The scene cuts to the produce stand.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, okay. Thanks anyway.

Bluey returns Bandit's underpants.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) I'll have to try someone else.

Bingo: (as Shopkeeper) Good luck!

Stripe: (offscreen) And cut.

Bandit hurriedly scratches his bum.

The scene cuts back to Muffin as the baker lady. The vase has been replaced with an upside-down hat.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Baker lady, have you ever been sick?

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Yes. I was sick yast lear.

The camera beeps.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I was sick yast lear.

The camera beeps.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I was sick last week.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I had wabies.

The scene cuts back to the hospital.

Nurse: (laughs)

Chilli: (laughing) What?

The scene cuts back to Muffin, Bluey, and Socks.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay, no.

Muffin scratches her bum while making direct eye contact with the camera.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) I can't use your purple pants. Thanks, baker lady.

Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Bye, Bluey!

Bluey: (offscreen) Barnicus!

The scene cuts to Lucky fishing. Bluey says something, and he shakes his head.

Bluey: [voiceover] Barnicus kept trying.

The scene cuts to Mackenzie. Bluey says something, and he shakes his head.

Bluey: [voiceover] But she couldn't find a single person...

The scene cuts to the front steps. Bluey sadly sits down on the stairs, holding Socks.

Bluey: [voiceover] ... that's never been sick.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, I can't find a single pair of purple pants from someone who's never been sick. It's not fair.

Bluey gasps theatrically.

Bluey: [voiceover] And then... Barnicus realized what the wise old Wolfhound was trying to teach her.

Bluey: (as Barnicus) Ohh. Everyone gets sick sometimes, not just Bumpy.

The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is gone.

Bluey: (from the tablet) Being sick is just a part of life.

Chilli: (sniffles)

The scene cuts back to Bluey's bed. She pats Socks' head; and Socks chews on her own leg again. Muffin is outside the window, holding up the night drawing.

Bluey: [voiceover] So from then on, Barnicus stopped thinking that it wasn't fair that Bumpy was sick.

Bluey hugs Socks, who stops chewing on her leg to lean into it.

The scene cuts to later on Bluey's bed. Now Bandit is holding up the daytime drawing. Bluey is reading a picture book to Socks, who is paying attention.

Bluey: [voiceover] She read books to Bumpy...

The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Muffin is holding up the night drawing again. Bluey is drawing with markers. Muffin is chewing on a piece of paper.

Bluey: [voiceover] ... did coloring in...

The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Bandit is holding up the day drawing again. Both Bluey and Muffin are watching something on a tablet.

Bluey: [voiceover] ...and watched cartoons together.

The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Bluey pantomimes waking up.

Bluey: [voiceover] Until one morning, she awoke...

Uncle Stripe's hands are briefly visible as he tosses Socks into Bluey's lap. Socks no longer has spots.

Bluey: [voiceover] ...to find Bumpy all better!

Socks: (yips happily)

The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is back.

Chilli, Bingo, and Nurse: Hooray!

Bingo: (squeals)

Chilli: Yeah!

The scene cuts to the front of the house. Everyone involved in the video is lined up, from left to right: Lucky, Mackenzie, Trixie, Bandit, Stripe, Bluey, Socks, and Muffin. Bluey is awkwardly holding Socks. Most of the characters link hands, hold them high, and bow (as the cast of a stage play does). Bluey and Muffin cannot, because Bluey's hands are full; they awkwardly half-bow instead.

Everyone but Bluey and Socks waves.

'All: See you tomorrow, Bingo!

Socks squirms free of Bluey's grasp, and bites Bandit on the ankle.

Bandit: Owww!

Bandit falls over. He struggles free for a moment.

Bandit: (laughing) Socks!

Socks bites Bandit on the bum. Everyone but Bluey and Muffin starts to laugh. Bluey looks worried She takes a step back, and knocks Muffin's toque over her eyes. Muffin stumbles around blindly. Stripe grabs Socks by the legs and tries to pull her off Bandit.

Bandit: Ow!

Stripe: Careful, Socks, he's got bum worms!

Muffin stumbles into Bluey and falls down.

The scene cuts back to the hospital.

Chilli, Bingo, and Nurse: (laugh)

Bingo: Again!

[End credits]

The music during the credits is the full arrangement of the episode music with strings and voice that plays after Bumpy gets better.

Trivia
The music in the episode is "Here Come the Grannies", which is also the same music from Grannies.
This is the second time Bluey and Bingo play their roles as grannies.
The line "We're going to hit that custard factory!", said by Bandit, is likely a reference to his voice actor's band, Custard.
Bus is the only episode to not have its title spoken in the title card. Bluey, as "Janet", instead says "this episode of Bluey is called... I forget".
Bus and BBQ are tied for having the shortest episode title.
Prior to the title card, Bandit sings “The Wheels On The Bus”

Trivia
This is the 2nd time Bingo is 3d in a scene since The Weekend, the pilot episode of the show.
"Poor little bug on the wall" sung by Bingo and Bluey was based on an existing children's camp song (Sample), which was then set about composing and arranging around the original, some inspiration for this piece is attributed to the works of Wes Anderson and French film composer Alexandre Michel Gérard Desplat.
Instruments included in the arrangement are: piano, cello, voice and accordion.
94A8AB2B-5202-4B39-9852-45B6290BEF0B.jpeg
"Poor little bug on the wall" has also been featured in a poster shared by Executive Director Daley Pearson, being promoted as a Covid public health campaign to encourage kids to hand-wash, since the length of the song is equivalent to the recommended 20 seconds hand-wash!
This is the first appearance of Judo.

While on a camping holiday, Bluey makes a new friend called Jean-Luc; Bluey may not understand him, but they find a common language playing and hunting for a wild Daddy pig.

Trivia
This episode ends with future Bluey reuniting with future Jean-Luc, future Muffin is heard offscreen.
Jean-Luc may be a reference to Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
The entire episode may be a parody of the episode "Darmok" in which Jean-Luc Picard must overcome a language barrier with an accomplice to survive an attacking beast.
The tree at the end of "Camping" is a Pink Trumpet tree.
The tree is in bloom in each frame of the timelapse, implying that each frame represents a year. There are twelve frames, the first representing the present, and the last frame only changes the time of day, so the end of the episode takes place 10 years in the future.
Despite a drawing of Jean-Luc holding a stick in the title, he never actually drew himself holding a stick.
On Day 3 of the episode, they drew the wild pig (Bandit) without his paw touching two pebbles. However, on day 4, the drawing of his paw touches two pebbles.
The bunny light is the first object that does not move at all in the ending credits.
There is no explanation as to why Bandit was acting like a pig, though knowing Bandit, he may have been initiating the game.
Bandit doesn’t talk, he only makes pig noises. However, he does speak in the camp fire scene but with no audio, just music playing over it.
In the French dub of this episode, Jean-Luc speaks English and his name is Johnny.
This is the first (and so far only) appearance of Jean-Luc and his parents.
This episode has a similar lesson to the Pikwik Pack episode, "Tibor’s Butterfly Buddy."
When the campfire scene is shown, Uncle Stripe has two spots on his face, when he's supposed to have one spot.

Trivia
Socks speaks clearly for the first time, saying "Ballerina!"
Radley Heeler appears in a picture on Nana’s wall.
Bluey's quote "OK, ready?" would be used again in Dunny.
The music playing when Bingo is acting out "ballerina" is a solo violin version of Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube" waltz.
Long Dog: This version is green with a teal spot and is wearing a knitted hat. It can be seen in Nana's basket of yarn.
Interestingly, it is uniquely flexible, bending around the yarn in the basket. It's possible that all the long dogs are somewhat flexible and that this is simply the first one seen to be so.

Trivia
This is the first episode since Yoga Ball to confirm Bluey's age. She is still six but claims she is about to turn seven. It's possible that this episode, and Pass the Parcel, which is when she has her seventh birthday, take place before Baby Race and Christmas Swim.
In the episode, Chilli refers to Bandit as 'Deep Blue'. Deep Blue was the first purpose-built chess computer to defeat a reigning chess world champion, specifically Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov, under standard tournament controls. Deep Blue's victory is considered a landmark in the development of artificial intelligence.
This is the third episode of the series to only take place in one location

Trivia
In the original version of this episode, the sauerkraut made Bandit sneeze. The ABC changed it to belching, in response to a complaint that the episode shows food allergies as harmless.[1]
Disney continued to broadcast the original version of this episode on its television channels for a while, but with subtitles for the updated episode.
The headbands that Bluey, and Bingo wear is a reference to the Naruto headbands.
When Bluey, Bingo and Chilli search for Floppy, parts of the plot are similar to the Eric Hill’s Spot book “Where's Spot?”
The episodes plot is told in reverse order. This could be a homage to the psychological thriller film "Memento" as the film's plot is told in a similar fashion.
Long Dog: The original long dog. It appears under the playroom table when the girls are shown dressing up as ninjas.

Trivia
This episode aired on the same date as the 2020 elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly.
The posters resemble three of the political parties in Australia, based on the colours and logo of the posters.
The green poster represents the Greens, with the green triangle on the poster being similar to the Greens logo.
The blue poster represents the Liberal National Coalition, based on the colour and the logo on the poster, an L with a square in the corner, resembling the Liberal logo.
The red poster represents Labor, based on the colour.
Sausages as well as other foods are given out at many polling booths in Australia, usually raising money for the organization (school, sporting club, church, etc) hosting the polling booth.
Winton replaces Bluey in the credits of this episode.
Long Dog: This long dog is a sausage. It can be found on the grill in front of Bandit as he is squirting Ketchup on his.
Interestingly, much like the previous long dog in Barky Boats, it also has it's eye(s) open.
When Bingo is getting more “popcorn” Mackenzie says “not again”, which may be a reference to Shops.
Goofs
When Coco says, "I told him not to be mean to that lion," her eyebrows disappear.

Trivia
On 1 March 2020, this episode aired on ABC Kids with the "Watch more Floogals on the ABC Kids iView app" bumper. It is likely that this was accidental as it (along with other episodes) usually ends with the "Watch more Bluey on the ABC Kids iView app" bumper.
This episode is similar to the episode "D.W. The Copycat" from Arthur.
This is the first appearance of Vet Corgi.
This is the first time Wendy is mentioned by name. It is also the first instance of the "Morning, Wendy" running gag, although she has been shocked by the Heeler family's antics in previous episodes.
Despite seeming to end her copycat game with dad when they find the budgie, Bluey actually inadvertently continues her copycat game by reenacting the events of the day with Bingo
Bluey's copycats from the budgie incident:
Finding the hurt budgie
Getting bit by the budgie
Using a shoebox
"Light as a feather"
Yelling at the other driver
Watching out for cars
The budgie being hurt by a cat
"It's out of our hands"
Long Dog: This long dog is cream colored with dark green ears, spot, and nose. It can be found in the vet's office atop the packages on the shelf, when Bandit and Bluey first enter.
It uses the same color palette as the packages that it sits on.

Trivia
This episode relies heavily on the work of American author and professor Joseph Campbell, who popularized the field of comparative mythology with his 1949 book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. In it, Campbell theorizes that all mythological heroes, regardless of their cultural origin, go through the same archetypal phases over the course of their adventures, many of which are referred to in Chilli's narration.
The exterior of Mackenzie's house is shown in this episode.
The bus that Doreen gets on has the livery of the Transport for Brisbane, an organisational division of the Brisbane City Council that operates the public bus service across Brisbane's metropolitan area.
Mackenzie’s Mum design is changed. The brown patch on her head now covers both eyes.
Bluey is replaced with Chloe, Winnie, Buddy and Pom-Pom with face paint in the end credits.
Towards the beginning of the episode, when Bandit tells Bingo to come with him to curry-swap, Bingo says “I am not interesting in that!” which is almost identical to a line that Chilli claims she said in the episode Promises.
This episode reveals MacKenzie's family name is Border Collie.
At the school fair;
Pony Lady can be seen with the ponies in the background.
Jack and Rusty both have camouflage face paints on, as a call back to the game and episode Army
Captain and Mia, the buddies from Barky Boats, can be seen together, most likely on a date.

Pat
Lucky
Wendy
Trivia
Lucky’s Dad is referred to as Pat for the first time.
The song Pat was singing is John Williamson’s "True Blue", which was an Australian folk song released in 1982.
The song Wendy sings is "I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside" a popular British music hall song, written by John A. Glover-Kind.
When Lucky updates Pat on the cricket score, he calls out "It's none for six, Dad!" In conventional parlance, this would mean that no runs have been scored and six wickets (outs) have been made. However, Pat's question about boundaries and Lucky's plausible answer ("one [four-run] boundary, two singles") signifies that cricket scores are given with wickets first and runs second. This is due to regional differences, in which Australian cricket places wickets before runs.
This is showcased further by the television commentator in The Weekend ("7 for 297").
This is the first episode to have been entirely skipped over in Disney’s release of the series. While no official reason was given, it is likely that Disney found the themes and content of the episode too inappropriate for the age demographic.
This would also happen to Family Meeting as well, though this decision was later reversed.
Despite not being featured on Disney networks and platforms, the episode is still available on DVDs and digital media releases within the USA and select other nations, and has also aired on other regional broadcasters (CBeebies, France 5 etc.).
This is the only episode to use iris out at the end.
Long Dog: There are two different long dogs in this episode:
The first is the original fridge magnet version. It can be seen during the scene in which Bandit attempts to eat Dim Sums.
The second long dog is grey with a dark grey spot. It can briefly be seen on top of the playroom bookshelf when Bandit is walking down the steps into the backyard.
This long dog disappears in the long shot when Bluey asks Pat to help. It then later reappears after Bingo is "born" (albeit this time as a dark oblong shadow.)

Trivia
This episode was released April 1, 2019 on ABC iview.
This is the fourth Season 1 episode to have regional differences, the first being BBQ, the second being Markets, the third being Chickenrat and the fifth being Taxi. In the Disney distributed versions of this episode, the part when Bingo asks Bandit how babies get in the Mother’s belly was removed since it was, in Disney’s eyes, a bit too cheeky and inappropriate.
The scene where Bandit plays with Bluey and Bingo by the swing, a ladybug can be seen twice, but the scene where the swing gets twisted, next scene the ladybug is nowhere to be seen. It appears again during the end credits of the episode.
The "Follow the Leader" song Bandit sings is based on the song "Funiculì, Funiculà." Contrary to popular belief, the song is not an Italian folk song. It was written in 1880 by Luigi Denza and Peppino Turco to commemorate the opening of the first funicular railway to the top of Mt. Vesuvius. The railway was destroyed when Vesuvius, an active volcano, erupted in March 1944.
Long Dog: Like the previous two episodes, it once again appears on the fridge.
This is the most times the magnet long dog has appeared in consecutive episodes.

Trivia
An ibis can be seen picking through the trash in this episode, further reinforcing the nickname "bin chicken."
At the end the busker’s hat contained the same five-dollar bill with the tooth fairy sticker that Bluey had in Markets.
This episode has two actors from Australian bands interacting together, that being Anthony Field from The Wiggles (as the postie) and David McCormack from Custard (as Bandit).
This is the first episode to air in 2020, meaning the first episode to air in the 2020s.
This episode, along with Hammerbarn and Featherwand, were the first Season 2 episodes to air in the US.
This episode's inspirational poster is based on the movie poster for the 1984 film Footloose.
This is the second time Bandit does the please face. The first being Verandah Santa.
Several cars at the zebra crossing and in the car park have vanity license plates with humorous messages written in letters and numbers. They are:
SBWFR8 ("subwoofers")
SPWY2 ("surprise")
W3ND73 ("Wendie/Wendy")
LUDO ("Ludo," after the studio that produces Bluey)
The portrait on the twenty-dollar note is a canine version of John Flynn, a Presbyterian minister who helped to found both the Australian Inland Mission and the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the world's first air ambulance. Flynn is probably depicted as a St. Bernard in honor of the breed famously being used to rescue avalanche victims in the Western Alps.
When Bandit says he "needs to change the address on this", the card he presents to the Postie is a 2010-2019 Queensland driver's license[1]. It's unclear what he's actually doing in this scene - he can't be changing the address on his driver's license, because you can't do that at a post office, and additional ID is not required[2].

Truck Driver (cameo)
Trivia
In Wendy and Judo's bathroom, there are only two toothbrushes. This may indicate that Wendy is a single parent, although it's not known what happened between her and Judo's dad.
Both Wendy and Judo cut their hair short.
The way Judo and Wendy care for their hair references how long-haired Chow Chows (their breed) need frequent baths and brush outs to keep their coat at optimal condition.
Wendy cutting her hair and Bandit commenting that she "had gone crazy" is a parallel to how during the course of the series she would be shown to be a little disturbed by Bandit's antics during his games with Bluey and Bingo and/or when trying to make them feel better, but now she's doing something crazy herself to make her daughter feel better.

Pat
Lucky
Wendy
Trivia
Lucky’s Dad is referred to as Pat for the first time.
The song Pat was singing is John Williamson’s "True Blue", which was an Australian folk song released in 1982.
The song Wendy sings is "I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside" a popular British music hall song, written by John A. Glover-Kind.
When Lucky updates Pat on the cricket score, he calls out "It's none for six, Dad!" In conventional parlance, this would mean that no runs have been scored and six wickets (outs) have been made. However, Pat's question about boundaries and Lucky's plausible answer ("one [four-run] boundary, two singles") signifies that cricket scores are given with wickets first and runs second. This is due to regional differences, in which Australian cricket places wickets before runs.
This is showcased further by the television commentator in The Weekend ("7 for 297").
This is the first episode to have been entirely skipped over in Disney’s release of the series. While no official reason was given, it is likely that Disney found the themes and content of the episode too inappropriate for the age demographic.
This would also happen to Family Meeting as well, though this decision was later reversed.
Despite not being featured on Disney networks and platforms, the episode is still available on DVDs and digital media releases within the USA and select other nations, and has also aired on other regional broadcasters (CBeebies, France 5 etc.).
This is the only episode to use iris out at the end.
Long Dog: There are two different long dogs in this episode:
The first is the original fridge magnet version. It can be seen during the scene in which Bandit attempts to eat Dim Sums.
The second long dog is grey with a dark grey spot. It can briefly be seen on top of the playroom bookshelf when Bandit is walking down the steps into the backyard.
This long dog disappears in the long shot when Bluey asks Pat to help. It then later reappears after Bingo is "born" (albeit this time as a dark oblong shadow.)

Trivia
In Wendy and Judo's bathroom, there are only two toothbrushes. This may indicate that Wendy is a single parent, although it's not known what happened between her and Judo's dad.
Both Wendy and Judo cut their hair short.
The way Judo and Wendy care for their hair references how long-haired Chow Chows (their breed) need frequent baths and brush outs to keep their coat at optimal condition.
Wendy cutting her hair and Bandit commenting that she "had gone crazy" is a parallel to how during the course of the series she would be shown to be a little disturbed by Bandit's antics during his games with Bluey and Bingo and/or when trying to make them feel better, but now she's doing something crazy herself to make her daughter feel better.

The Heeler Family:
Bandit Heeler
Chilli Heeler
Bingo Heeler
Bluey Heeler
Trivia
This is the first episode:
To air in 2021, and the only episode outside of Season 3.
To have two shots of The Heeler Family's House in one episode.
Where the sky in the background changes tone/colour.
This is the last episode of Season 2, and the only episode of that season to not release in 2020.
This is the only episode to:
Be focused or mention the festival of Easter.
Have Isy Lauf be involed with the music in the show.
This is one of 4 episodes not airing in active rotation on the Disney/Disney Junior channels in the United States due to the seasonality of the episode, alongside Dad Baby, Verandah Santa, and Christmas Swim.
It is, however, able to be streamed on Disney+ & TVNZ+.
In Queensland, where Bluey is set, Rabbits are actually illegal to have, as they are seen as pests.[2]
When the girls wake up in the morning, it is not seen as to whether "the footprints" were in their room when they woke up.
Inside of the postbox is a Chatterbox, which is also known as "Fortune Teller", and is a popular pastime of children.
It is revealed in this episode that Bingos favourite colour is Blue, the only character to have a favourite colour revealed.
One of the fridge magnets is shaped like the roundel used by Transport for London, or more famously used by The London Underground.
When Bluey mentions that there is a castle in London, Bingo says that the leaves may be describing the castle in the sandpit. The castle in London referenced is more than likely the infamous Tower of London.
The Yoga Ball from the episode of the same name is seen again, and is found where a chair would be, continuing to support Bandits argument that he can't use a regular chair.
When entering the kitchen, Bandit is seen behind the work station slicing fruit. However, as the girls open the fridge, he cannot be seen in the background, while in the next shot he is seen working behind there again.

Bandit
Chilli
Socks
Muffin
Aunt Trixie
Uncle Stripe
Trivia
Muffin's full name is Muffin Cupcake Heeler.
This is the second time in season three where Bandit says "Classic Stripe", with the first being Whale Watching.
CGI effects are used during the first chase scene, and partially the second.
This is the second time a middle name is revealed. The first one was Bluey's in the episode Family Meeting.
Coincidently, Family Meeting aired before this episode.
The app the pups use to draw may be a reference to Snapchat, particularly in the scene where Muffin turns Stripe into the gorillaman by using a filter just like a Snapchat filter.
The app may have been named after Apple's FaceTime.
This is the first time Muffin is shown punished on-screen.
The music during the chase sequences is based on the prelude to the first act of the opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.
The ukulele shown under Muffin's bed can be seen in the episode Bedroom.
The "Why" in which Muffin makes when told to look behind her is the same voice clip used from Muffin Cone.
The scream when Muffin was picked up by Stripe was reused from The Sleepover.
The images that are composited into the background of Stripe's phone are:
The Palace of Westminster (also known as the Houses of Parliament)
The Eiffel Tower
A starfield
The Great Wall of China
A picture of Stripe and Trixie
A picture of Stripe, Trixie, and Muffin
A picture of Stripe
Running gags
Muffin using the gorilla bikini filter on Stripe.
Censorship
In the Disney version of this episode, when Muffin runs into a bathroom, the scene has been cropped to hide Trixie sitting on the toilet in the background.
Errors
While spinning through the air (before hitting the swimming pool), the camera footage from Stripe's phone intermittently captures the balcony from which Muffin dropped the phone. However, Muffin, Stripe, and Trixie are all absent from the camera footage, despite them standing on the balcony.

The episode music is an arrangement of John Ryan's Polka. The composer of this tune is not known, but often attributed to Seán Ryan.
This tune is most famous from the soundtrack of the film Titanic.
This is the second time Bandit farted.
This is the first appearance of Wendy, Zara and Chattermax.
Fairy rings are a ring-shaped pattern of mushrooms growing out of the ground. In European folklore, fairy rings are stated to be numerous things, such as a portal to the realm of the fairies or marking spots where fairies held dances. In most stories, fairy rings are considered bad omens and are to be avoided.
Bandit's line: "Are you not entertained?!" is a reference to the 2000 movie Gladiator

Trivia
"Hansel and Gretel", compiled by brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812, details the story of two children who lose their way in a forest before finding a small cottage made of treats and being lured inside by a witch who intends to eat them. Many of Grimms' fairy tales include content that could be considered questionable by modern audiences (in "H&G"'s case, cannibalism) and could be the reason that Bandit and Bluey agree that the story was a "wild ride."
Younger versions of Bandit, Stripe, Rad, Nana, and Bob are seen in this episode via flashback.
If Bandit is correct on how he met Chilli, a younger version of Chilli can also be seen in this episode.
This marks Bob's first physical and speaking role since Grannies, 101 episodes earlier. This is the longest absence a character has had in Bluey.
However, this is not even Bob as he is during the time of the series, making Grannies the only time Bob has ever appeared in his granddad state (not counting him in pictures).
The dispute mentioned in The Show about how Bandit and Chilli met is a result of Bandit believing that he saw a young Chilli while on vacation with his family, as shown in the episode. Although Chilli admits she and her family would used to go on vacations when she was younger, she has no memory of this occurring, leaving the current situation ambiguous.
The kid whom Bandit speculates to be Chilli is wearing a "She-Ra" costume.
In the 80's, Nana had a perm, which means that she had permanent wavy hair.
This episode shows that Bandit, Stripe & Rad prefer their fish battered, rather than crumbed.
This episode shows that Bandit was ten years old during the 80's. Assuming that "Bluey" occurs in real world time (or at least around the time the series first aired), this would mean that Bandit is in his 40's during the course of the series.
In one scene, Bandit and Stripe are seen playing a dog version of the video game “Double Dragon”, which was released in 1987. This means that this flashback likely takes place either in 1987, 1988, or 1989.
During a montage, a cassette tape with "Bad Medicine" written on it could a reference to the Bon Jovi song of the same name released in 1988.

Trivia
Like with Teasing, the episode was pulled from ABC iView due to derogatory terms and copyright issues due to the storyboard artist. However, an edited version with the relevant scene redubbed can still be seen on ABC iView. This edit will also be present on the Disney distributed version of the episode. It was redubbed to "Ooo-ooo".
Bluey and Bingo's games throughout the episode is an allegory to Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the evolution of Earth and life in general. In addition, "Mother" Bluey (now acting old with a cane) walking to the porch swing is suppose to represent a person passing away and entering/ascending to Heaven (according to Christianity) with Bandit's remark hinting this.
This is the second time death is mentioned in the series, the first being "Copycat".
Bandit makes a subtle 4th-wall break when he exclaims "I'm not taking advice from a cartoon dog!" Despite he himself being a cartoon dog from whom viewers regularly take parenting advice.
Long Dog: This long dog is made of polystyrene and as a result is notably more cuboid in shape. It can be seen on the left side of the screen on the ground when Bluey is waving goodbye to Bingo.

Trivia
The title wasn't changed to "Favorite Thing" to suit American audiences
This episode first aired on ABC Kids in 2020 as a sneak peek.
The song the Heelers sing before eating their food is a Christian hymn called "For the Golden Corn," which Waldorf schools have incorporated as part of their method. The lyrics were altered slightly, changing references to the Christian God to "Mother Earth."
Long Dog: Like the last episode, this long dog is dark colored and appears on top of the bookshelf. It is visible during Bluey's fantasy retelling of morning tea-time.

Trivia
The soundtrack played throughout this episode is based on Spring - Vivaldi
Throughout the episode, 2 light bulbs have burnt out every time something awkward happens.
The 'gagging' sound which Bandit makes after eating is used again in Baby Race.
Long Dog: This episode also has two long dogs:
The first is blue-grey with white patterns. It is wearing a red scarf or ascot and has a somewhat elderly appearance to it.
This is the most realistic depiction of a real dog that any long dog has been so far.
The second is another vague oblong shadow situated atop the bookshelf.
