At a lecture, Marcus introduces Doctor Bandit Heeler, who presents a fossilized bone from his archaeological research. As Bandit explains, the bone provides evidence of the evolution of modern bipedal dogs from distant, quadrupedal ancestors. However, after concluding his remarks, Bandit begins gnawing on the fossil, demonstrating that two-legged dogs aren't so different from the four-legged variety.

Trivia
This episode was shown on April Fools' Day.
This episode debuts Jack and his family.
This is the first episode where Bluey has no lines.
This episode is theorised to take place during The Adventure, as evidenced by Princess Chloe riding Bluey as a horse in the background.
This is the second episode where it focuses on one of Bluey’s friends, in this case Jack and Rusty.
This is the second episode where on the title card, a child, other than Bluey or Bingo, says "This episode of Bluey is called [episode title]". In this episode's case, Jack says the episode's title.
Disney+ closed captioning miss-quotes Rusty's declaration of "LZ (pronounced 'L-Zed') is no good!" as "Owl's Head is no good!"
The bird Rusty and Jack encounter while on patrol is an Australian brushturkey. In spite of the name and the physical resemblance, they are not related to North American turkeys.
Rusty’s cry of “Get to the chopper!” echoes the iconic quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character in the first film of the Predator franchise.
During the scene where Rusty and Jack are sitting in the helicopter (treehouse), the music playing is reminiscent of Buffalo Springfield's "For What it's Worth"
Long Dog: This version of the long dog is a dull coloration of the original toy wearing an army hat. It is visible on the right side of the screen on the table with the vase of flowers, at both the start and end of the episode.
Joe Brumm stated in an interview[1] that this episode was inspired by the work of child psychologist Lev Vygotsky, in particular an experiment where children were asked to stand still as long as they could, and then remember a list of food items. Then, the experiment was repeated, but the children were told to stand still because you're the sentry for those kids playing army, and to remember a list of food items because we're playing shopping. In the context of a game, the children performed much better.
In the Australian version, Jack says, "There's something wrong with me", but in the Disney+ edit, he says, "There's something going on with me."

Dad tells Bluey to mind her manners at the table - they're not animals. But when Bluey gets her hands on a stick of magic asparagus, she shows them everyone's got a wild side.

Episode Recap
Warning Spoilers! ->
bestbits: Bandit the walrus.

lifelesson: Having manners makes us different to animals.

The Heeler family is sitting at the table having dinner with Bandit trying to remind everyone to use their manners - Bluey asks why manners are necessary. Bandit says that it's because they're not animals, and Chilli gives Bluey a piece of ‘magic asparagus’ which she claims will turn everyone into animals.

Bluey points the asparagus at her parents and Bingo to try to turn them into different animals, and they play along, while Bluey changes them each time they do something impolite. This results in an extravaganza of animal reenactments: donkey (Bandit), piglet (Bingo), chicken (Chilli), goat (Chilli), elephant (Bandit), meerkat (Bandit), mouse (Chilli), penguin (Bingo).... finally Bluey "turns" them all into peacocks in an attempt at some obedience.

Unfortunately this doesn’t work for Bandit, the male "peacock", who performs a mating dance at Chilli. Bluey "turns" Chilli and Bingo into lions, and they scare Bandit outside up a tree before running off to stalk the neighbor. Bluey then has Bandit be a walrus, and he falls out of the tree making walrus sounds.

After "turning" the stalking "lions" (who’ve hunted poor Lucky’s dad) into a parrot (Bingo) and a bunny (Chilli), Bluey hustles everyone inside to have some “manners” lessons. This ends in mayhem with Chilli being "turned" into a worm, Bandit as "Daddy Walrus" pretending to attempt to poo on the rug and Bingo as a bird eating the magic asparagus.

In a last ditch attempt, Bluey gets everyone to the table and gets Bingo to say, “doggies” so that everyone can return to normal and continue eating dinner. Bluey has learned her lesson and displays beautiful manners, even offering to clean the kitchen. Unfortunately though, Bingo keeps pretending to be a bird and shouts, "Chicken!", causing Bandit to start acting like one.

Trivia
This is the first episode:
To feature Stripe, Trixie, Muffin and Socks Heeler.
To have a character named but not show up, in this case being Aunt Mary.
This is also the only time which Mary has been mentioned in any episode.
For international viewings of this programme, outside of Australia & New Zealand, capsicum has been replaced by peppers (also known as bell peppers).
BBQ and Bus are tied for having the shortest episode title.
When Bluey, Muffin, and Socks are running to see Bingo, Socks' body is layered underneath her snout and front leg.

VIEW SOURCE
Birds are the most seen animals in Bluey, they appear everywhere.

Emu
The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the second-tallest living bird after its ratite relative the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia, but the Tasmanian, Kangaroo Island and King Island subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788.
