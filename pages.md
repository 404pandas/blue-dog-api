At a lecture, Marcus introduces Doctor Bandit Heeler, who presents a fossilized bone from his archaeological research. As Bandit explains, the bone provides evidence of the evolution of modern bipedal dogs from distant, quadrupedal ancestors. However, after concluding his remarks, Bandit begins gnawing on the fossil, demonstrating that two-legged dogs aren't so different from the four-legged variety.

Trivia
This episode was shown on April Fools' Day.
This episode debuts Jack and his family.
This is the first episode where Bluey has no lines.
This episode is theorised to take place during The Adventure, as evidenced by Princess Chloe riding Bluey as a horse in the background.
This is the second episode where it focuses on one of Bluey’s friends, in this case Jack and Rusty.
This is the second episode where on the title card, a child, other than Bluey or Bingo, says "This episode of Bluey is called [episode title]". In this episode's case, Jack says the episode's title.
Disney+ closed captioning miss-quotes Rusty's declaration of "LZ (pronounced 'L-Zed') is no good!" as "Owl's Head is no good!"
The bird Rusty and Jack encounter while on patrol is an Australian brushturkey. In spite of the name and the physical resemblance, they are not related to North American turkeys.
Rusty’s cry of “Get to the chopper!” echoes the iconic quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character in the first film of the Predator franchise.
During the scene where Rusty and Jack are sitting in the helicopter (treehouse), the music playing is reminiscent of Buffalo Springfield's "For What it's Worth"
Long Dog: This version of the long dog is a dull coloration of the original toy wearing an army hat. It is visible on the right side of the screen on the table with the vase of flowers, at both the start and end of the episode.
Joe Brumm stated in an interview[1] that this episode was inspired by the work of child psychologist Lev Vygotsky, in particular an experiment where children were asked to stand still as long as they could, and then remember a list of food items. Then, the experiment was repeated, but the children were told to stand still because you're the sentry for those kids playing army, and to remember a list of food items because we're playing shopping. In the context of a game, the children performed much better.
In the Australian version, Jack says, "There's something wrong with me", but in the Disney+ edit, he says, "There's something going on with me."

Dad tells Bluey to mind her manners at the table - they're not animals. But when Bluey gets her hands on a stick of magic asparagus, she shows them everyone's got a wild side.

Episode Recap
Warning Spoilers! ->
bestbits: Bandit the walrus.

lifelesson: Having manners makes us different to animals.

The Heeler family is sitting at the table having dinner with Bandit trying to remind everyone to use their manners - Bluey asks why manners are necessary. Bandit says that it's because they're not animals, and Chilli gives Bluey a piece of ‘magic asparagus’ which she claims will turn everyone into animals.

Bluey points the asparagus at her parents and Bingo to try to turn them into different animals, and they play along, while Bluey changes them each time they do something impolite. This results in an extravaganza of animal reenactments: donkey (Bandit), piglet (Bingo), chicken (Chilli), goat (Chilli), elephant (Bandit), meerkat (Bandit), mouse (Chilli), penguin (Bingo).... finally Bluey "turns" them all into peacocks in an attempt at some obedience.

Unfortunately this doesn’t work for Bandit, the male "peacock", who performs a mating dance at Chilli. Bluey "turns" Chilli and Bingo into lions, and they scare Bandit outside up a tree before running off to stalk the neighbor. Bluey then has Bandit be a walrus, and he falls out of the tree making walrus sounds.

After "turning" the stalking "lions" (who’ve hunted poor Lucky’s dad) into a parrot (Bingo) and a bunny (Chilli), Bluey hustles everyone inside to have some “manners” lessons. This ends in mayhem with Chilli being "turned" into a worm, Bandit as "Daddy Walrus" pretending to attempt to poo on the rug and Bingo as a bird eating the magic asparagus.

In a last ditch attempt, Bluey gets everyone to the table and gets Bingo to say, “doggies” so that everyone can return to normal and continue eating dinner. Bluey has learned her lesson and displays beautiful manners, even offering to clean the kitchen. Unfortunately though, Bingo keeps pretending to be a bird and shouts, "Chicken!", causing Bandit to start acting like one.

This is the first episode:

To have a character named but not show up, in this case being Aunt Mary.
This is also the only time which Mary has been mentioned in any episode.
For international viewings of this programme, outside of Australia & New Zealand, capsicum has been replaced by peppers (also known as bell peppers).
BBQ and Bus are tied for having the shortest episode title.
When Bluey, Muffin, and Socks are running to see Bingo, Socks' body is layered underneath her snout and front leg.

Trivia
The soundtrack on this episode is based on Tribe of Avaren. [1]
This is the first episode where on the title card, an adult character says "This episode of Bluey is called [episode title]". instead of a child character. In this episode's case, Calypso says the episode's title.
This episode reveals that Bluey hasn't learned to write yet.
Long Dog: This long dog is grey with a dark grey spot on it's back. Additionally it's eye(s) are open, a feature uncommon to the long dogs. It can be seen to the left of the rock pond after the barky boats reach the bottom after Calypso's story.

Trivia
This episode is currently listed as the 1st episode of Season 3 on Disney+ and the Bluey Website, as while Perfect aired before the rest of the season, it is shown in 14th place instead.
In the opening shot with the usual first eight tones of the theme tune (which is played with a harmonica normally but with a piano in this instance), Bluey can be seen playing with the guitar on the seventh note, plus again with an extra note afterwards.
In the previous episode Perfect, Bandit is seen talking to Fido about wanting to be neutered, and so it may be possible that this action has gone through, seeing how the now-spare room is being removed of baby items five years after Bingo was born.
When discussing, the girls mention that "She (Gloria) was a Christmas present to me from Grandad". We later see Bingo say to Bob "Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are.", showing that the grandparent called Grandad is Mort (their maternal grandfather).
Bingo's line "good night" is reused from Dunny.

The gi that Bluey wears in this episode has a white belt, this switches to a yellow belt by the final night, signifying she has gone up a level in Karate.

The term “Aliens” was formerly said in the episode Neighbours by a Irish Wolfhound called Maynard when he yelled “Are there any Aliens?!”, and in this episode, it was slightly reused when Bluey asked Bandit if there are any Aliens on the moon.

Trivia
This episode is a one-time spin-off of the entire series as it focuses primarily on Bluey's sister, Bingo.
Bingo gets her own title card, intro and outro in this episode. She says "This episode of Bingo is called "Bingo"" instead of "This episode of Bluey is called "Bingo"".
Chilli says “sweet as, Bingo”, in a Kiwi accent, a reference to what country the Kiwi animal lives in.
Bingo breaks the fourth wall when she looks at the camera and tells her answer for "I Spy", which in this case, is a rug.
It is revealed that Bingo loves to eat raspberries and blueberries.
The soundtrack that plays throughout this episode is Mozart's Sonata No. 16.
This episode's inspirational poster is based on a movie poster for Home Alone.
This is the 1st instance of a sound effect in the title card.
Bandit's response "Not again!" to the missing New Zealand piece is a possible reference to the countless times NZ has been left off world maps. Including the game board for Risk™ and on a map in an episode of Star Trek.
Long Dog: This version of the dog is teal with a purple nose and is reading a newspaper. It can be seen on the right side of the screen during the scene where Chilli comforts Bingo in the playroom closet.

Trivia
Even though the episode is listed to be before "The Pool", this is after the episode on cable guides.
Bluey and Bingo's hand faces move without redrawing them, but Chilli is the only one seen actually changing her hand puppet’s expression.
The family appears in the episode, but the episode focusses more on their hand playing.
This episode might be a reference to Glover, a N64 game that stared a living glove.
The episode title is a reference to the actual Blue Mountains in Western Sydney.
Several close-up shots of Bandit is used in the entire episode.
Long Dog: This long dog is purple-ish with a teal-ish spot on it's back. It can be spotted on the left side of the screen by the rocks immediately after the title card.

Bluey's Big Play

Broadcast Information
Airdate
December 22th, 2020 (Australia)
November 2022-present (United States)
Credits

Bluey's Big Play is a stage show based on Bluey. The show follows the Heeler family through a full day from sunrise to bedtime. Bluey and Bingo work to keep Bandit from reading on his phone; in addition, Bluey and Chilli talk about being a good example as a big sister to Bingo.

The audio track for Bluey's Big Play is prerecorded by the voice actors from Bluey. Each character in the show is represented onstage by human-sized puppets. Each puppet requires at least one puppeteer to operate their facial expressions (eyes and eyebrows) and arms, while at times a second puppeteer is needed for actions that control their legs and tail, or to add and remove props from the puppet's hands. The puppeteers perform onstage actions in sync with the audio track provided.

The backdrop is designed to obscure movements of the secondary puppeteers as they enter and exit various scenes. The show begins with a wide exterior view onto the Heeler home, before moving into the living room, backyard, and Bluey and Bingo's bedroom.

The show runs approximately 50 minutes, about 6 times the length of a typical Bluey episode (8 minutes).

Production History
The play was developed in 2019, first premiered on December 22th, 2020 on QPAC and went on an Australian Tour starting May 2021; after a 1-year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. tour started November 2022.

Plot
The show opens on a wide view of the Heeler neighborhood, with bin chicken puppets in the foreground being controlled by puppeteers. Eventually the sound of a dump truck scares them off (a reference to Bin Night).

As day breaks, the characters are introduced via an extended game of Musical Statues.

Afterwards, Bandit receives a text from Lucky's Dad about lawn grubs. After failing to conceal his phone activity from the family, Bluey and Bingo hide his phone in order to force Bingo to play with them. Their distractions reference numerous episodes in Season 1 of Bluey, including The Magic Xylophone, Daddy Robot, Grannies, and episodes featuring Chattermax.

Interspersed between the scenes where Bandit is trying to find his phone, Bluey complains to Chilli about Bingo copying her moves (itself a reference to Copycat). Bandit explains that it's a good thing for little sisters to copy their big sisters, and that by their actions big sisters can make little sisters feel as tall as giants, or as small as mice.

During one of these exchanges, Chilli tells Bingo about Auntie Brandy, which surprises Bluey because she didn't know that she had an auntie. Chilli explains that they had previously fought, and she hasn't talked to her sister in years.

Eventually, Bandit is able to get his phone, which upsets Bluey. However, she remembers to forgive Bingo by bedtime. Bandit feigns that the phone is out of battery and helps lead a dance with Bluey, Bingo and the audience, before they both go to sleep for the night.

After the sisters fall asleep, the show ends with Chilli calling Brandy, saying, "It's me, your little sister."

Trivia
The musical statues scene (the intro scene) is initially different in this episode. The show's order is Mum (Chilli), Dad (Bandit), Bingo and Bluey. In Bluey's Big Play, the order is Bluey, Dad (Bandit), Bingo and Mum (Chilli); after several iterations (and Bluey admitting to playing until she wins), the show order is played out.

AD
History
After the success of the first album, a second album is due to be released on 21st April 2023 [1].

Joff Bush serves as the primary composer of the show, writing roughly half of the scores for each episode, while also leading a handful of additional composers, including David Barber. Bush graduated from the Queensland Conservatorium, where he met executive producer Daley Pearson. Each episode has a unique individual style (influenced by Bushs' work on Charlie & Lola), with live instruments used most of the time, and Bush has stated that he likes to become involved in the episodes as they are scripted.[2]

Bush recorded a soundtrack for the first series of the program, titled Bluey: The Album, which was released on 22 January 2021. The soundtrack debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart in February 2021. It was recognised as the first children's album to reach the top of the charts in Australia. It won Best Children's Album at the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, and an APRA Screen Music Award for Best Soundtrack Album in 2021.

Dance Mode! features songs from the first, second and third series of Bluey. The first half of the album contains upbeat and more active songs, while the second half contains a quieter tone, with a more reflective feel to the tracks. "Dance Mode" (the track) is describe as an upbeat, EDM style song, while both tracks "Army" and "Grandad" lean into the bluegrass genre with banjo and whistle instrumentation.

The rear of the Album

The first single, Dance Mode, was released on 27th January 2023[3], with The BeeeeOOP Walk released four weeks later on 24th February.[4] Another four weeks later, Rain (Boldly In The Pretend) was released as well.[5][6]

Bush wrote every track on this album, and co-wrote with Craig Parry & Marly Lüske (for Bluey Theme Tune (Dance Remix)), Steve Peach (Chattermax), Pluto Jonze (Army & Grandad) and Jazz D'Arcy (for Copycat & Rain (Instrumental). The Album has a run-time of over 42 minutes, similar to the first album, with the shortest tracks running for around a minute, with three (Sticky Gecko, Rainbow & Rain (BITP)) for over four minutes.

Description
Loved by parents and children for its heartfelt and funny portrayal of young family life and celebration of play, the season follows Bluey a six year old Blue Heeler dog, who loves to play and turns everyday family life into extraordinary adventures that unfold in unpredictable and hilarious ways, bringing her family, friends and community into her world of fun.

The album features many songs, all original compositions from Season 1. Including music from fan favorite episodes such as 'Keepy Uppy', 'Here Come The Grannies!', 'Pool' 'The Creek' and more

Two new versions of the catchy theme tune are included as an extended version and 'Instrumental'.

The first half of the album features upbeat songs to get the whole family dancing like 'The Claw' and 'Taxi'.

The second half takes a tranquil tone with highlights 'I Know A Place (The Creek Song)' (with vocals from Helena Czajka & Jazz D'Arcy), and 'Camping'.

This is the perfect album for Bluey fans of any age.

Since Bluey first launched on ABC Kids in October 2018 the Brisbane based program has exploded in popularity in Australia, and we are thrilled that Bluey is now being discovered across the rest of the world.

In the US Bluey Season 1 reached an impressive 16 million total views across Disney Channel and Disney Junior in Q 4 2019.

Bluey won a Logie award for Most Outstanding Children's Programme AACTA award and two Screen Producers Australia awards.

Airing
Bluey is an Australian preschool animated television series that premiered on ABC Kids on 1 October 2018. The program was created by Joe Brumm and is produced by Queensland-based company Ludo Studio. It was commissioned by The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The British Broadcasting Corporation, with BBC Studios holding global distribution and merchandising rights. The show airs on numerous channels, though most nations can access the show through Disney Channel & Junior and Disney+.

The show follows Bluey, an anthropomorphic six-year-old Blue Heeler puppy who is characterised by her abundance of energy, imagination and curiosity of the world. The young dog lives with her father, Bandit; mother, Chilli; and younger sister, Bingo, who regularly joins Bluey on adventures as the pair embark on imaginative play together. Other characters featured each represent a different dog breed. Overarching themes include the focus on family, growing up and wider Australian culture. The program was created and is produced in Queensland; its capital city Brisbane inspires the show's setting.

Bluey has received consistently high viewership in Australia on both broadcast television and video on demand services. It has influenced the development of merchandise and a stage show featuring its characters. The program has won two Logie Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program as well as an International Emmy Kids Award in 2019. It has been praised by television critics for depicting a modern everyday family life, constructive parenting messages and the role of Bandit as a positive father figure. Bluey was renewed for a third series in October 2020.

History
Conception
In July 2017, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) co-commissioned Bluey as an animated series for preschool children to be developed by Queensland production company Ludo Studio.[1][2] The production received funding from Screen Australia and Screen Queensland, with the setting of the series drawing upon the unique semi-tropical Queensland climate. Created by Joe Brumm, the series was inspired by his experience in raising two daughters. Brumm wanted to portray the importance of children participating in imaginative play, having witnessed his own child's experiences, creating the title character Bluey as a Cattle Dog to give the series an Australian voice. Brumm had previously worked on children's programs in the United Kingdom as a freelance animator and decided to create Bluey as a replica of the program Peppa Pig for an Australian audience.[3]

Brumm conceived the idea independently in 2016, and produced a one-minute pilot through his company Studio Joho, with a small team in their spare time. Brumm approached Ludo Studio to develop the series; co-founders Charlie Aspinwall and Daley Pearson pitched the pilot at conferences such as MIPCOM in France.[4][5] Brumm stated that the first pilot contained some "dangerous" character behaviours which drew the attention of studio executives; this included Bandit pushing Bluey and Bingo on a swing in an unsafe way.[6] Pearson expressed that it was difficult to pitch the series as it was not high-concept; but rather "just a show about family and games".[7]

The studio developed a five-minute animation sample that was pitched at the Asian Animation Summit in Brisbane in 2016, and was thereby noticed by ABC and BBC executives.[8][9] Michael Carrington of the ABC viewed the presentation and secured $20,000 of funding for the studio to produce a refined, seven-minute pilot. The new pilot was presented at the Asian Animation Summit in 2017. The two networks officially ordered 52 seven-minute episodes of Bluey, with the BBC investing 30 percent of the funding and acquiring the global rights for distribution and merchandising.[10] The series was produced entirely in Australia by a local team, many of whom were first-time animators from Brisbane.[11] The program was announced to premiere in Australia on ABC Kids, followed by CBeebies.[1][2]

Production
Writing
The stories featured in Bluey depict Bluey and Bingo engaging in imaginative play.[12] Brumm wanted to show that self-directed and unstructured play is natural in shaping children and allowing them to develop. He consulted research based on socio-dramatic play, reading the works of Sara Smilansky and Vivian Paley, who both had backgrounds in early childhood education.[5] The episodes show the parents as guides for their children, who allow them to explore their immediate surroundings independently, giving them opportunities to practise adult roles.[12] Brumm drew inspiration for scripts from his own experiences in watching his daughters play, which he described was "as natural to them as breathing".[10] The program's scripts show how children can use gameplay to learn lessons and integrate the world of adults into their own; Brumm noticed how his children would recreate interactions such as visits to the doctor, through roleplay. Pearson stated that gameplay represents children's first experiences of collaboration, cooperation, responsibility and emotions such as jealousy. Brumm discovered the importance of play-based learning after his daughter struggled with formal education, which led him to exclude elements of literacy and numeracy in Bluey and focus on the depiction of life skills. Brumm stated that he wanted the series to depict his experience as a parent rather than aim for children to be explicitly taught something. His creative aims were to make children laugh, and show parents what children can learn while engaged in play.

An Austrailian Cattle Dog (also known as a Blue Heeler)

The characters of Bluey each represent a particular dog breed, some of which are drawn from Brumm's personal life. Brumm had a Blue Heeler named Bluey throughout his childhood, in addition to a Dalmatian named Chloe and another Blue Heeler named Bandit. [13] Bandit's career as an archaeologist was inspired by Brumm's older sibling Adam.

Brumm writes the majority of episode scripts, with Aspinwall labelling the series as an "observational" show, depicting Brumm's family life, and producer Sam Moor describing it as "[Brumm's] life on screen"; when producing the pilot, Brumm's daughters were aged between four and six, like Bluey and Bingo. Brumm's process for writing sometimes begins with making notes about his family's experiences; including games his children play and the conflict that arises between them. For this reason, Brumm has described the process as a challenge for other writers on the series. Moor stated that there are few writers besides Brumm, mostly animators already working on the series. The program was designed to be a co-viewing experience for parents and their children to enjoy together. Brumm described the process of writing each episode as "a chance to make a short film". The conflict and humour in the episodes stems from Bandit's relationship with his daughters. Bluey has been described as "rough and tumble" by Pearson, with both her and Bingo being seen to subvert the stereotypes of female characters, but rather have the characteristics of real puppies. This has led to uninformed viewers questioning if the characters are boys or girls. Pearson has credited the decision of Bluey and Bingo being girls to resemble the real families of Brumm, Aspinwall and McCormack. In relation to the humour of the series, Brumm has stated there is a lot of physical activity and "craziness".

Storyboarding and animation
Bluey is animated in-house at Ludo Studio in Brisbane, in Fortitude Valley, where approximately 50 people work on the program. Costa Kassab serves as one of the art directors of the series, who has been credited with drawing the locations of the series which are based on real places in Brisbane, including parks and shopping centres. Locations featured in the series have included Queen Street Mall and South Bank. Brumm determines the specific locations which are to be included. Post-production of the series takes place externally in South Brisbane.

Approximately fifteen episodes of the series are developed by the studio at any one time across a range of production stages. After story ideas are conceived, the script-writing process takes place for up to two months. The episodes are then storyboarded by artists, who produce 500 to 800 drawings over three weeks while consulting the writer's script. After the storyboard is finished, a black and white animatic is produced, to which the dialogue recorded independently by voice artists is added. The episodes are then worked on for four weeks by animators, background artists, designers, and layout teams. The entire production team views a near-completed episode of Bluey on a Friday. Pearson stated that over time, the viewings developed into test screenings where members of production would bring their family, friends and children to watch the episode. The complete production process for an episode takes three to four months. Moor described the program's colour palette as "a vibrant pastel".

During the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the production staff of 50 were required to work on the episodes remotely from home. A skeleton crew of three remained working on the series at the studio. After restrictions eased in May, this number increased to ten and later 20. Production on the third series concluded in April 2022.

Trivia
The show airs on ABC Kids in Australia, as well as Disney Channel in the USA, India and other countries, CBeebies in the UK, Taiwan and Australia, and TVNZ in New Zealand.
Bluey aired on Disney Channel eleven months after the ABC Kids release.
In the Disney distributed version of the show, there are many contents changed or removed.
There are at least than 20 changes to the show from Disney, such as in BBQ where the word from the original Australian release "capsicum" is replaced with "pepper", or Chickenrat where the sauerkraut makes Bandit sneeze compared to the original burp. Alongside this, the episode Dad baby was outright banned from airing.
Bluey only began airing on Cbeebies, the under-7 channel of BBC in early 2021.
The show has been dubbed into at least 30 languages (most of which can be found on Disney+ or on Disney Channel in their respective countries).
In China, the show can be watched on Youku and Tencent Video in either English or Mandarin.[14], and seasons one and two can also be viewed on ABC IVIEW.
TVNZ aired season 3 before it premiered on Disney+ and Disney Channel, and is the only other broadcaster (with the exception of ABC Kids who have aired Season 3B (Musical Statues-The Decider).
The show's main typeface text font is Hello Headline by Deartype.
There is a long sausage-type dog called 'long dog' hidden in many episodes. In Charades, it’s hidden in the knitting on the couch. Long dog was designed by one of the background artists in series one, and the pup also turns up in some of the books.
Most of the kids voice actors are a mystery, so to protect the children's identity as they grow older.

Bluey's Big Play

Broadcast Information
Airdate
December 22th, 2020 (Australia)
November 2022-present (United States)
Credits

Bluey's Big Play is a stage show based on Bluey. The show follows the Heeler family through a full day from sunrise to bedtime. Bluey and Bingo work to keep Bandit from reading on his phone; in addition, Bluey and Chilli talk about being a good example as a big sister to Bingo.

The audio track for Bluey's Big Play is prerecorded by the voice actors from Bluey. Each character in the show is represented onstage by human-sized puppets. Each puppet requires at least one puppeteer to operate their facial expressions (eyes and eyebrows) and arms, while at times a second puppeteer is needed for actions that control their legs and tail, or to add and remove props from the puppet's hands. The puppeteers perform onstage actions in sync with the audio track provided.

The backdrop is designed to obscure movements of the secondary puppeteers as they enter and exit various scenes. The show begins with a wide exterior view onto the Heeler home, before moving into the living room, backyard, and Bluey and Bingo's bedroom.

The show runs approximately 50 minutes, about 6 times the length of a typical Bluey episode (8 minutes).

Production History
The play was developed in 2019, first premiered on December 22th, 2020 on QPAC and went on an Australian Tour starting May 2021; after a 1-year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. tour started November 2022.

Plot
The show opens on a wide view of the Heeler neighborhood, with bin chicken puppets in the foreground being controlled by puppeteers. Eventually the sound of a dump truck scares them off (a reference to Bin Night).

As day breaks, the characters are introduced via an extended game of Musical Statues.

Afterwards, Bandit receives a text from Lucky's Dad about lawn grubs. After failing to conceal his phone activity from the family, Bluey and Bingo hide his phone in order to force Bingo to play with them. Their distractions reference numerous episodes in Season 1 of Bluey, including The Magic Xylophone, Daddy Robot, Grannies, and episodes featuring Chattermax.

Interspersed between the scenes where Bandit is trying to find his phone, Bluey complains to Chilli about Bingo copying her moves (itself a reference to Copycat). Bandit explains that it's a good thing for little sisters to copy their big sisters, and that by their actions big sisters can make little sisters feel as tall as giants, or as small as mice.

During one of these exchanges, Chilli tells Bingo about Auntie Brandy, which surprises Bluey because she didn't know that she had an auntie. Chilli explains that they had previously fought, and she hasn't talked to her sister in years.

Eventually, Bandit is able to get his phone, which upsets Bluey. However, she remembers to forgive Bingo by bedtime. Bandit feigns that the phone is out of battery and helps lead a dance with Bluey, Bingo and the audience, before they both go to sleep for the night.

After the sisters fall asleep, the show ends with Chilli calling Brandy, saying, "It's me, your little sister."

Trivia
The musical statues scene (the intro scene) is initially different in this episode. The show's order is Mum (Chilli), Dad (Bandit), Bingo and Bluey. In Bluey's Big Play, the order is Bluey, Dad (Bandit), Bingo and Mum (Chilli); after several iterations (and Bluey admitting to playing until she wins), the show order is played out.

Trivia
Buddy picks his nose during the end credits and the episode ends just as he puts his finger in his mouth.
However, in the Disney+ and BBC versions (the latter is used by other international broadcasters), the finger in the mouth is cut out.
The montage of the girls playing with Bob in the playground is the same where the events of Bike unfold.
In this episode, Bluey is shown being able to ride her bike, while in the previous epiosde of Bike, she was shown learning to ride.
This is the first appearance of Mrs. Retriever, Missy, Buddy, Juniper, Juniper’s Mum, Harley, Jasper W, and Harley's Dad.
The name of the cartoon Bluey and Bingo watch is unknown, though the name given to one of the characters in said cartoon is "Mixed-Up Murphy"; it is not known wether this is just the character name, the name of the show, or both.
Mixed-Up Murphy is spoken of again in Yoga Ball.
Long Dog: This marks the first time the long dog appears as an easter egg. This time it appears early on during pick-up time after the camera shifts to focus on Bandit and Buddy.
Bob Bilby is based on a Dinki Di brand Bilby hand puppet.[2]
Goofs and Errors
To the beginning of the episode, Bentley and Missy open the door to the Kindy to let the parents in. However, they are seen sitting with their classmates in the next shot.
In the scene where Bluey, Bingo and Chilli watch the televisions outside the supermarket, a discoloured red Stripe can be seen with Trixie in the background. The couple is later seen at the fireworks scene correctly coloured, confirming that the discolouring was a mistake.
When Chilli takes a photo on her phone, there is always a flash on the forward facing camera. However, this also includes the selfie camera, where the flash has no use.
Sausage Dog Toy: This marks the first time the sausage dog toy's appears twice. It appears early on during pick up when the camera shifts focus to Bandit and Buddy and again under the table in the playroom.
When the scene with Bob Bilby on the bike shows Bingo, Bingo's dark orange fur is missing on her face.
Trixie's spots and lining change suddenly when she's talking to Stripe.
When the scene shows the picture of Bingo and Bluey in Stevo's truck, Bingo's hand is the same colour as her arm, and Bluey is in the truck with Bingo, but the colours make her look like Bandit, with the dark fur covering the middle of her face.

"Bluey & Bingo’s Grandad."

Appearance
Bob is a Blue Heeler with white, grey, black, dark grey and brown fur. He has white feet, hands, chest, muzzle and eyebrows, grey legs, leg spots, arms, torso, tail tip and head spots, dark grey leg splotches, leg spots, tail stem and right head, black outer ears, and brown leg spots, head spots, left head and inner ears. He also has a black nose, beard whiskers on his muzzle and part of his left ear missing.

In his younger years (during the 80s), his grey fur used to be blue and his dark grey and brown (on his head) fur used be black, similar to his son Bandit. His left ear also used to be whole as well.

Biography
Bob has no known real friends yet, but he is the husband of Chris (Nana), the dad of Bandit, Stripe, and Rad, the father-in-law of Chilli and Trixie, and the grandpa of Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks.

S3E2 - Bedroom (mentioned)
S3E26 - Fairytale (flashback)
Trivia
He has a piece of his left ear missing.
Bob is voiced (as a retiree) by writer, actor, director, producer, teacher, essayist and painter Ian McFadyen.
Bob has had the longest absence of any character, with a gap of 101 episodes between his physical appearances in Grannies and Fairytale, but even his appearance in Fairytales was a flashback.
Since the episode called Christmas Swim, many fans have speculated him to be dead, while others think that he was divorced, others think he passed away due to dementia, others think he's too busy focusing on a job or was likely sent to a hospital in a prolonged time for long-term care. No official explanation has been provided yet.
In a 2021 interview[1], Joe Brumm confirmed that Bob is alive and would make an appearance in season 3, offering "proof of life" - so presumably not referring to Fairytale. He offered an out-of-character reason for his absence: Mort was given all the "Grandad" stories to show some of Chilli's side of the family.
Although there are a couple of people that think he just isn't too connected to the family due to a possible conflict. However, it's strange to think that the family aren't somewhat concerned about it nor they explain the loss of it.
This is acknowledged in an episode Bedroom, Bingo says “Goodnight Grandpa Bob, wherever you are,” hinting Bob’s absence.
In the short Humpty Dumpty, Muffin mentions him as "grandad" when Chilli decides to send him a message. Although, she doesn't specify which one. She could be referring to Trixie's father but many believe that the message is in fact being sent to Bob.
His nick name is Bobba, used by Nana in the Episode "Grannies", and in the Grannies book.
A younger version of him can be seen in Fairytale
Also, despite his more youthful appearance in the said episode, he doesn't even remember his sons' name.
He had blue and black fur when he was younger, making him look like Bandit.
Bob did make a major appearance in the book Where's Bluey? where he makes a cameo holding a soda can in one page that takes place in the episode BBQ. His small appearance did mean something, in which you have to find items scattered across the scenario full of characters, he was one of them.

Cameos in different media
Cameos in different media
VIEW SOURCE
Since Bluey has been released, there has been several cameos, references, or at least merch, shown in different media such as TV shows and other medias.

TV Shows
Abbott Elementary, S02E04: Micah wears a Bluey themed blazer. Micah then disrupted the entire class by saying 'mum' in an Australian accent, saying 'I love Bingoooo', and even sang the Bluey theme. It isn't the first time Micah disrupted his class, as from what he is understand that he is obsessed with Bluey. Gregory eventually sends Micah to Principal Ava’s office, which does absolutely nothing, which resulted in Gregory embracing the Bluey.
Mr. Inbetween, S03E02: A snippet of The Magic Xylophone episode can be seen in a prison recreation room by an inmate, which then another inmate switched to a football match. After that same inmate refuses to change the channel back, the other inmate attacks him to retrieve the remote control before changing it back himself.
(If there are some more cameos or parodies of Bluey in different media, pleast list here. If any moderators requested to delete this, then I will comply and delete it.)

Trivia
This implies that Cats do exist in the Bluey universe, but it is unknown if they act the same as dogs outside of this show.
It seems to be a parody of the popular Canadian series, PAW Patrol[1].
Muffin appears to be a fan of the program, as she has Cat Squad bedsheets and a Cat Squad motorcycle.
Art Director Costa Kassab named the cats. Cleo wears yellow, Cooper wears red, Cate wears purple.[1]
However, in Turtleboy, the red cat answers a question addressed to "Catty", so these may not be the canon names.

Bandit's Best Bits
Trivia
The ABC iView version renamed the event to "Cheese and Crackers! Bandit's Best Bits!"
Teasing and The Weekend didn't air during the event due to the fact that this was a 1-hour event.
Those episodes are in the ABC iView version.
Daddy Putdown is the only season one episode in this event that aired on TV.
However, if you were to count Teasing and The Weekend that would be a total of three episodes in this event.

Disney Channel is a cable subscription-based channel aimed at kids ages 6-11 and the primary broadcaster of Bluey in the United States and many other countries. Even though Bluey is usually rated TV-G, it is rated TV-Y here. Unfortunately, Disney Channel's versions of Bluey are the same censored versions streamed on Disney+.

AD
Trivia
The United States feed of Disney Channel has never aired the episode Dad Baby. No official reason for this is known, but it has been suspected that the episode was considered inappropriate by Disney. The banning of the episode has been quite contriversial with some.
Bluey may be one of, if not the only show originally targeted at kids younger than 6 aired on Disney Channel that is seen outside of the Mickey Mornings and Disney Junior blocks. Some promos for Bluey on Disney Channel tend to try to make the show more appealing to older kids.
