Description
The bedroom includes a king-sized bed, two small coffee tables on each side of the bed, a balcony/verandah, and a master bathroom. The rarely seen fourth wall features a dresser with a large mirror mounted over it. There are several potted plants around the room. The door to the verandah is usually open to let in fresh air. Jacaranda trees bloom right outside, dropping flowers onto the balcony.

Errors
In season 1, the family photo over the head of the bed shows Chilli with a different fur pattern -- the brown patch over her eye overlaps the part of her cheek that is normally cream coloured. This is an older design, as seen in The Weekend and the 2017 pilot.

The map that bingo has

CrazyWorld is an Amusement Park that the heelers went to in Mt. Mumandad. It features rides, attractions, and a giant statue of a purple squirrel in the center. The squirrel seems to be its mascot. Bluey and Bingo had bought teddies, a magic wand, and a backpack with a flag back home from the gift shop.
